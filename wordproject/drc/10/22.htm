<h3>Chapter 22 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>And David spoke to the Lord the words of this canticle, in the day that the Lord delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And he said: The Lord is my rock, and my strength, and my saviour. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>God is my strong one, in him will I trust: my shield, and the horn of my salvation: he lifteth me up, and is my refuge: my saviour, thou wilt deliver me from iniquity. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>I will call on the Lord who is worthy to be praised: and I shall be saved from my enemies. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>For the pangs of death have sur rounded me: the floods of Belial have made me afraid. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>The cords of hell compassed me: the snares of death prevented me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>In my distress I will call upon the Lord, and I will cry to my God: and he will hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry shall come to his ears. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>The earth shook and trembled, the foundations of the mountains were moved, and shaken, because he was angry with them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>A smoke went up from his nostrils, and a devouring fire out of his mouth: coals were kindled by it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>He bowed the heavens, and came down: and darkness was under his feet. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And he rode upon the cherubims, and flew: and slid upon the wings of the wind. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>He made darkness a covering round about him: dropping waters out of the clouds of the heavens. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>By the brightness before him, the coals of fire were kindled. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>The Lord shall thunder from heaven: and the most high shall give forth his voice. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>He shot arrows and scattered them: lightning, and consumed them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>And the overflowings of the sea appeared, and the foundations of the world were laid open at the rebuke of the Lord, at the blast of the spirit of his wrath. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>He sent from on high, and took me, and drew me out of many waters. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>He delivered me from my most mighty enemy, and from them that hated me: for they were too strong for me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>He prevented me in the day of my affliction, and the Lord became my stay. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>And he brought me forth into a large place, he delivered me, because I pleased him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>The Lord will reward me according to my justice: and according to the cleanness of my hands he will render to me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>Because I have kept the ways of the Lord, and have not wickedly departed from my God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>For all his judgments are in my sight: and his precepts I have not removed from me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>And I shall be perfect with him: and shall keep myself from my iniquity. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>And the Lord will recompense me according to my justice: and according to the cleanness of my hands in the sight of his eyes. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>With the holy one thou wilt be holy: and with the valiant perfect. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>With the elect thou wilt be elect: and with the perverse thou wilt be perverted. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>And the poor people thou wilt save: and with thy eyes thou wilt humble the haughty. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>For thou art my lamp, O Lord: and thou, O Lord, wilt enlighten my darkness. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>For in thee I will run girded: in my God I will leap over the wall. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>God, his way is immaculate, the word of the Lord is tried by fire: he is the shield of all that trust in him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>Who is God but the Lord: and who is strong but our God? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>God who hath girded me with strength, and made my way perfect. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34 </span>Making my feet like the feet of harts, and setting me upon my high places. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35 </span>He teacheth my bands to war: and maketh my arms like a bow of brass. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36 </span>Thou hast given me the shield of my salvation: and thy mildness hath multiplied me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37 </span>Thou shalt enlarge my steps under me: and my ankles shall not fail. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38 </span>I will pursue after my enemies, and crush them: and will not return again till I consume them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39 </span>I will consume them and break them in pieces, so that they shall not rise: they shall fall under my feet. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40 </span>Thou hast girded me with strength to battle: thou hast made them that resisted me to bow under me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41 </span>My enemies thou hast made to turn their back to me: them that hated me, and I shall destroy them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42 </span>They shall cry, and there shall be none to save: to the Lord, and he shall not hear them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="43">43 </span>I shall beat them as small as the dust of the earth: I shall crush them and spread them abroad like the mire of the streets. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="44">44 </span>Thou wilt save me from the contradictions of my people: thou wilt keep me to be the head of the Gentiles: the people which I know not, shall serve me, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="45">45 </span>The sons of the stranger will resist me, at the hearing of the ear they will obey me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="46">46 </span>The strangers are melted away, and shall be straitened in their distresses. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="47">47 </span>The Lord liveth, and my God is blessed: and the strong God of my salvation shall be exalted: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="48">48 </span>God who giveth me revenge, and bringest down people under me, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="49">49 </span>Who bringest me forth from my enemies, and liftest me up from them that resist me: from the wicked man thou shalt deliver me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="50">50 </span>Therefore will I give thanks to thee. O Lord, among the Gentiles, and will sing to thy name. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="51">51 </span>Giving great salvation to his king, and shewing mercy to David his anointed, and to his seed for ever. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
