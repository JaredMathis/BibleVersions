<h3>Chapter 23 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>Now these are David's last words. David the son of Isai said: The man to whom it was appointed concerning the Christ of the God of Jacob, the excellent psalmist of Israel said: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>The spirit of the Lord hath spoken by me and his word by my tongue. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>The God of Israel said to me, the strong one of Israel spoke, the ruler of men, the just ruler in the fear of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>As the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, shineth in the morning without clouds, and as the grass springeth out of the earth by rain. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>Neither is my house so great with God, that he should make with me an eternal covenant, firm in all things and assured. For he is all my salvation, and all my will: neither is there ought thereof that springeth not up. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>But transgressors shall all of them be plucked up as thorns: which are not taken away with hands. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>And if a man will touch them, he must be armed with iron and with the staff of a lance: but they shall be set on fire and burnt to nothing. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>These are the names of the valiant men of David. Jesbaham sitting in the chair was the wisest chief among the three, he was like the most tender little worm of the wood, who killed eight hundred men at one onset. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>After him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the three valiant men that were with David when they defied the Philistines, and they were there gathered together to battle. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>And when the men of Israel were gone away, he stood and smote the Philistines till his hand was weary, and grew stiff with the sword: and the Lord wrought a great victory that day: and the people that were fled away, returned to take spoils of them that were slain. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And after him was Semma the son of Age of Arari. And the Philistines were gathered together in a troop: for there was a field full of lentils. And when the people were fled from the face of the Philistines, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>He stood in the midst of the field, and defended it, and defeated the Philistines: and the Lord gave a great victory. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>Moreover also before this the three who were princes among the thirty, went down and came to David in the harvest time into the cave of Odollam: and the camp of the Philistines was in the valley of the giants. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>And David was then in a hold. and there was a garrison of the Philistines then in Bethlehem. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And David longed, and said: O that some man would get me a drink of the water out of the cistern, that is in Bethlehem, by the gate. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>And the three valiant men broke through the camp of the Philistines, and drew water out of the cistern of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and brought it to David: but he would not drink, but offered it to the Lord, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>Saying: The Lord be merciful to me, that I may not do this: shall I drink the blood of these men that went, and the peril of their lives? therefore he would not drink. These things did these three mighty men. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>Abisai also the brother of Joab, the son of Sarvia, was chief among three: and he lifted up his spear against three hundred whom he slew, and he was renowned among the three, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>And the noblest of three, and was their chief, but to the three first he attained not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>And Banaias the son of Joiada a most valiant man, of great deeds, of Cabseel: he slew the two lions of Moab, and he went down, and slew a lion in the midst of a pit, in the time of snow. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>He also slew an Egyptian, a man worthy to be a sight, having a spear in his hand: but he went down to him with a rod, and forced the spear out of the hand of the Egyptian, and slew him with his own spear. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>These things did Banaias the son of Joiada. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>And he was renowned among the three valiant men, who were the most honourable among the thirty: but he attained riot to the first three: and David made him of his privy council. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>Asael the brother of Joab was one of the thirty, Elehanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>Semma of Harodi, Elica of Harodi, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>Heles of Phalti, Hira the son of Acces of Thecua, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>Abiezer of Anathoth, Mobonnai of Husati, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>Selmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>Heled the son of Baana, also a Netophathite, Ithai the son of Ribai of Gabaath of the children of Benjamin, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>Banaia the Pharathonite, Heddai of the torrent Gaas, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>Abialbon the Arbathite, Azmaveth of Beromi, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>Eliaba of Salaboni. The sons of Jassen, Jonathan, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>Semma of Orori, Aliam the son of Sarar the Arorite, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34 </span>Eliphelet the son of Aasbai the son of Machati, Eliam the son of Achitophel the Gelonite, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35 </span>Hesrai of Carmel, Pharai of Arbi, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36 </span>Igaal the son of Nathan of Soba, Bonni of Gadi, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37 </span>Selec of Ammoni, Naharai the Berothite, armourbearer of Joab the son of Sarvia, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38 </span>Ira the Jethrite, Gareb also a Jethrite; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39 </span>Urias the Hethite, thirty and seven in all. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
