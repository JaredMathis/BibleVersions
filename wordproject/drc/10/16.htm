<h3>Chapter 16 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>And when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold Siba the servant of Miphiboseth came to meet him with two asses, laden with two hundred loaves of bread, and a hundred bunches of raisins, a hundred cakes of figs, and a vessel of wine. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And the king said to Siba: What mean these things? And Siba answered: The asses are for the king's household to sit on: and the loaves and the figs for thy servants to eat, and the wine to drink if any man be faint in the desert. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>And the king said: Where is thy master's son? And Siba answered the king: He remained in Jerusalem, saying: To day will the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And the king said to Siba: I give thee all that belonged to Miphiboseth. And Siba said: I beseech thee let me find grace before thee, my lord, O king. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>And king David came as far as Bahurim: and behold there came out from thence a man of the kindred of the house of Saul named Semei, the son of Gera, and coming out he cursed as he went on, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>And he threw stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people, and all the warriors walked on the right, and on the left side of the king. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>And thus said Semei when he cursed the king: Come out, come out, thou man of blood, and thou man of Belial. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>The Lord hath repaid thee for all the blood of the house of Saul: because thou hast usurped the kingdom in his stead, and the Lord hath given the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and behold thy evils press upon thee, because thou art a man of blood. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>And Abisai the son of Sarvia said to the king: Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? I will go, and cut off his head. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>And the king said: What have I to do with you, ye sons of Sarvia? Let him alone and let him curse: for the Lord hath bid him curse David: and who is he that shall dare say, why hath he done so? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And the king said to Abisai, and to all his servants: Behold my son, who came forth from my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more now a son of Jemini? let him alone that he may curse as the Lord hath bidden him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>Perhaps the Lord may look upon my affliction, and the Lord may render me good for the cursing of this day. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And David and his men with him went by the way. And Semei by the hill's side went over against him, cursing, and casting stones at him, and scattering earth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>And the king and all the people with him came weary, and refreshed themselves there. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>But Absalom and all his people came into Jerusalem, and Achitophel was with him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>And when Chusai the Arachite, David's friend, was come to Absalom, he said to him: God save thee, O king, God save thee, O king. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And Absalom said to him: Is this thy kindness to thy friend? Why wentest thou not with thy friend? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>And Chusai answered Absalom: Nay: for I will be his, whom the Lord hath chosen, and all this people, and all Israel, and with him will I abide. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>Besides this, whom shall I serve? is it not the king's son? as I have served thy father, so will I serve thee also. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>And Absalom said to Achitophel: Consult what we are to do. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>And Achitophel said to Absalom: Go in to the concubines of thy father, whom he hath left to keep the house: that when all Israel shall hear that thou hast disgraced thy father, their hands may be strengthened with thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>So they spread a tent for Absalom on the top of the house, and he went in to his father's concubines before all Israel. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>Now the counsel of Achitophel, which he gave in those days, was as if a man should consult God: so was all the counsel of Achitophel, both when he was with David, and when he was with Absalom. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
