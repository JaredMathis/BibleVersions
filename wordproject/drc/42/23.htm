<h3>Chapter 23 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>AND the whole multitude of them rising up, led him to Pilate. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And they began to accuse him, saying: We have found this man perverting our nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, and saying that he is Christ the king. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>And Pilate asked him, saying: Art thou the king of the Jews? But he answering, said: Thou sayest it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And Pilate said to the chief priests and to the multitudes: I find no cause in this man. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>But they were more earnest, saying: He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee to this place. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>But Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the man were of Galilee? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>And when he understood that he was of Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him away to Herod, who was also himself at Jerusalem, in those days. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And Herod, seeing Jesus, was very glad; for he was desirous of a long time to see him, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to see some sign wrought by him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>And he questioned him in many words. But he answered him nothing. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>And the chief priests and the scribes stood by, earnestly accusing him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And Herod with his army set him at nought, and mocked him, putting on him a white garment, and sent him back to Pilate. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And Herod and Pilate were made friends, that same day; for before they were enemies one to another. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And Pilate, calling together the chief priests, and the magistrates, and the people, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>Said to them: You have presented unto me this man, as one that perverteth the people; and behold I, having examined him before you, find no cause in this man, in those things wherein you accuse him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>No, nor Herod neither. For I sent you to him, and behold, nothing worthy of death is done to him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>I will chastise him therefore, and release him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>Now of necessity he was to release unto them one upon the feast day. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>But the whole multitude together cried out, saying: Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>Who, for a certain sedition made in the city, and for a murder, was cast into prison. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>And Pilate again spoke to them, desiring to release Jesus. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>But they cried again, saying: Crucify him, crucify him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>And he said to them the third time: Why, what evil hath this man done? I find no cause of death in him. I will chastise him therefore, and let him go. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>But they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified; and their voices prevailed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>And he released unto them him who for murder and sedition, had been cast into prison, whom they had desired; but Jesus he delivered up to their will. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>And as they led him away, they laid hold of one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country; and they laid the cross on him to carry after Jesus. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>And there followed him a great multitude of people, and of women, who bewailed and lamented him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>But Jesus turning to them, said: Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not over me; but weep for yourselves, and for your children. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>For behold, the days shall come, wherein they will say: Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that have not borne, and the paps that have not given suck. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>Then shall they begin to say to the mountains: Fall upon us; and to the hills: Cover us. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>For if in the green wood they do these things, what shall be done in the dry? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>And there were also two other malefactors led with him to be put to death. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>And when they were come to the place which is called Calvary, they crucified him there; and the robbers, one on the right hand, and the other on the left. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34 </span>And Jesus said: Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do. But they, dividing his garments, cast lots. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35 </span>And the people stood beholding, and the rulers with them derided him, saying: He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the elect of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36 </span>And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37 </span>And saying: If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38 </span>And there was also a superscription written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39 </span>And one of those robbers who were hanged, blasphemed him, saying: If thou be Christ, save thyself and us. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40 </span>But the other answering, rebuked him, saying: Neither dost thou fear God, seeing thou art condemned under the same condemnation? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41 </span>And we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward of our deeds; but this man hath done no evil. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42 </span>And he said to Jesus: Lord, remember me when thou shalt come into thy kingdom. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="43">43 </span>And Jesus said to him: Amen I say to thee, this day thou shalt be with me in paradise. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="44">44 </span>And it was almost the sixth hour; and there was darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="45">45 </span>And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="46">46 </span>And Jesus crying out with a loud voice, said: Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit. And saying this, he gave up the ghost. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="47">47 </span>Now the centurion, seeing what was done, glorified God, saying: Indeed this was a just man. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="48">48 </span>And all the multitude of them that were come together to that sight, and saw the things that were done, returned striking their breasts. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="49">49 </span>And all his acquaintance, and the women that had followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="50">50 </span>And behold there was a man named Joseph, who was a counsellor, a good and just man, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="51">51 </span>(The same had not consented to their counsel and doings;) of Arimathea, a city of Judea; who also himself looked for the kingdom of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="52">52 </span>This man went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="53">53 </span>And taking him down, he wrapped him in fine linen, and laid him in a sepulchre that was hewed in stone, wherein never yet any man had been laid. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="54">54 </span>And it was the day of the Parasceve, and the sabbath drew on. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="55">55 </span>And the women that were come with him from Galilee, following after, saw the sepulchre, and how his body was laid. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="56">56 </span>And returning, they prepared spices and ointments; and on the sabbath day they rested, according to the commandment. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
