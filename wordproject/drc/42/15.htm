<h3>Chapter 15 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>NOW the publicans and sinners drew near unto him to hear him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And the Pharisees and the scribes murmured, saying: This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>And he spoke to them this parable, saying: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>What man of you that hath an hundred sheep: and if he shall lose one of them, doth he not leave the ninety-nine in the desert, and go after that which was lost, until he find it? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>And when he hath found it, lay it upon his shoulders, rejoicing: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>And coming home, call together his friends and neighbours, saying to them: Rejoice with me, because I have found my sheep that was lost? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>I say to you, that even so there shall be joy in heaven upon one sinner that doth penance, more than upon ninety-nine just who need not penance. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>Or what woman having ten groats; if she lose one groat, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently until she find it? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>And when she hath found it, call together her friends and neighbours, saying: Rejoice with me, because I have found the groat which I had lost. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>So I say to you, there shall be joy before the angels of God upon one sinner doing penance. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And he said: A certain man had two sons: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And the younger of them said to his father: Father, give me the portion of substance that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his substance. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And not many days after, the younger son, gathering all together, went abroad into a far country: and there wasted his substance, living riotously. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>And after he had spent all, there came a mighty famine in that country; and he began to be in want. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And he went and cleaved to one of the citizens of that country. And he sent him into his farm to feed swine. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks the swine did eat; and no man gave unto him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And returning to himself, he said: How many hired servants in my father's house abound with bread, and I here perish with hunger? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>I will arise, and will go to my father, and say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>I am not worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>And rising up he came to his father. And when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and was moved with compassion, and running to him fell upon his neck, and kissed him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>And the son said to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee, I am not now worthy to be called thy son. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>And the father said to his servants: Bring forth quickly the first robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it, and let us eat and make merry: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>Because this my son was dead, and is come to life again: was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>Now his elder son was in the field, and when he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>And he said to him: Thy brother is come, and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>And he was angry, and would not go in. His father therefore coming out began to entreat him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>And he answering, said to his father: Behold, for so many years do I serve thee, and I have never transgressed thy commandment, and yet thou hast never given me a kid to make merry with my friends: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>But as soon as this thy son is come, who hath devoured his substance with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>But he said to him: Son, thou art always with me, and all I have is thine. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>But it was fit that we should make merry and be glad, for this thy brother was dead and is come to life again; he was lost, and is found. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
