<h3>Chapter 19 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>AND entering in, he walked through Jericho. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And behold, there was a man named Zacheus, who was the chief of the publicans, and he was rich. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>And he sought to see Jesus who he was, and he could not for the crowd, because he was low of stature. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And running before, he climbed up into a sycamore tree, that he might see him; for he was to pass that way. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>And when Jesus was come to the place, looking up, he saw him, and said to him: Zacheus, make haste and come down; for this day I must abide in thy house. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>And he made haste and came down; and received him with joy. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>And when all saw it, they murmured, saying, that he was gone to be a guest with a man that was a sinner. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>But Zacheus standing, said to the Lord: Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have wronged any man of any thing, I restore him fourfold. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>Jesus said to him: This day is salvation come to this house, because he also is a son of Abraham. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>As they were hearing these things, he added and spoke a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately be manifested. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>He said therefore: A certain nobleman went into a far country, to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And calling his ten servants, he gave them ten pounds, and said to them: Trade till I come. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>But his citizens hated him: and they sent an embassage after him, saying: We will not have this man to reign over us. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And it came to pass, that he returned, having received the kingdom: and he commanded his servants to be called, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>And the first came, saying: Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And he said to him: Well done, thou good servant, because thou hast been faithful in a little, thou shalt have power over ten cities. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>And the second came, saying: Lord, thy pound hath gained five pounds. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>And he said to him: Be thou also over five cities. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>And another came, saying: Lord, behold here is thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up what thou didst not lay down, and thou reapest that which thou didst not sow. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>He saith to him: Out of thy own mouth I judge thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up what I laid not down, and reaping that which I did not sow: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>And why then didst thou not give my money into the bank, that at my coming, I might have exacted it with usury? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>And he said to them that stood by: Take the pound away from him, and give it to him that hath ten pounds. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>And they said to him: Lord, he hath ten pounds. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>But I say to you, that to every one that hath shall be given, and he shall abound: and from him that hath not, even that which he hath, shall be taken from him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>But as for those my enemies, who would not have me reign over them, bring them hither, and kill them before me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>And having said these things, he went before, going up to Jerusalem. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethania, unto the mount called Olivet, he sent two of his disciples, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>Saying: Go into the town which is over against you, at your entering into which you shall find the colt of an ass tied, on which no man ever hath sitten: loose him, and bring him hither. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>And if any man shall ask you: Why do you loose him? you shall say thus unto him: Because the Lord hath need of his service. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>And they that were sent, went their way, and found the colt standing, as he had said unto them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said to them: Why loose you the colt? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34 </span>But they said: Because the Lord hath need of him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35 </span>And they brought him to Jesus. And casting their garments on the colt, they set Jesus thereon. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36 </span>And as he went, they spread their clothes underneath in the way. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37 </span>And when he was now coming near the descent of mount Olivet, the whole multitude of his disciples began with joy to praise God with a loud voice, for all the mighty works they had seen, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38 </span>Saying: Blessed be the king who cometh in the name of the Lord, peace in heaven, and glory on high! 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39 </span>And some of the Pharisees, from amongst the multitude, said to him: Master, rebuke thy disciples. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40 </span>To whom he said: I say to you, that if these shall hold their peace, the stones will cry out. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41 </span>And when he drew near, seeing the city, he wept over it, saying: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42 </span>If thou also hadst known, and that in this thy day, the things that are to thy peace; but now they are hidden from thy eyes. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="43">43 </span>For the days shall come upon thee, and thy enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and straiten thee on every side, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="44">44 </span>And beat thee flat to the ground, and thy children who are in thee: and they shall not leave in thee a stone upon a stone: because thou hast not known the time of thy visitation. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="45">45 </span>And entering into the temple, he began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="46">46 </span>Saying to them: It is written: My house is the house of prayer. But you have made it a den of thieves. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="47">47 </span>And he was teaching daily in the temple. And the chief priests and the scribes and the rulers of the people sought to destroy him: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="48">48 </span>And they found not what to do to him: for all the people were very attentive to hear him. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
