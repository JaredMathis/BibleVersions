<h3>Chapter 2 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>AND it came to pass, that in those days there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that the whole world should be enrolled. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>This enrolling was first made by Cyrinus, the governor of Syria. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>And all went to be enrolled, every one into his own city. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth into Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem: because he was of the house and family of David, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>To be enrolled with Mary his espoused wife, who was with child. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>And it came to pass, that when they were there, her days were accomplished, that she should be delivered. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him up in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And there were in the same country shepherds watching, and keeping the night watches over their flock. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>And behold an angel of the Lord stood by them, and the brightness of God shone round about them; and they feared with a great fear. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>And the angel said to them: Fear not; for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, that shall be to all the people: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>For, this day, is born to you a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord, in the city of David. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And this shall be a sign unto you. You shall find the infant wrapped in swaddling clothes, and laid in a manger. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly army, praising God, and saying: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>Glory to God in the highest; and on earth peace to men of good will. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And it came to pass, after the angels departed from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another: Let us go over to Bethlehem, and let us see this word that is come to pass, which the Lord hath shewed to us. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>And they came with haste; and they found Mary and Joseph, and the infant lying in the manger. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And seeing, they understood of the word that had been spoken to them concerning this child. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>And all that heard, wondered; and at those things that were told them by the shepherds. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>But Mary kept all these words, pondering them in her heart. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God, for all the things they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>And after eight days were accomplished, that the child should be circumcised, his name was called JESUS, which was called by the angel, before he was conceived in the womb. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>And after the days of her purification, according to the law of Moses, were accomplished, they carried him to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>As it is written in the law of the Lord: Every male opening the womb shall be called holy to the Lord: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>And to offer a sacrifice, according as it is written in the law of the Lord, a pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>And behold there was a man in Jerusalem named Simeon, and this man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel; and the Holy Ghost was in him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>And he had received an answer from the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Christ of the Lord. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>And he came by the Spirit into the temple. And when his parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him according to the custom of the law, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>He also took him into his arms, and blessed God, and said: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>Now thou dost dismiss thy servant, O Lord, according to thy word in peace; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>Because my eyes have seen thy salvation, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>Which thou hast prepared before the face of all peoples: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>A light to the revelation of the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>And his father and mother were wondering at those things which were spoken concerning him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34 </span>And Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother: Behold this child is set for the fall, and for the resurrection of many in Israel, and for a sign which shall be contradicted; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35 </span>And thy own soul a sword shall pierce, that, out of many hearts, thoughts may be revealed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36 </span>And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser; she was far advanced in years, and had lived with her husband seven years from her virginity. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37 </span>And she was a widow until fourscore and four years; who departed not from the temple, by fastings and prayers serving night and day. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38 </span>Now she, at the same hour, coming in, confessed to the Lord; and spoke of him to all that looked for the redemption of Israel. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39 </span>And after they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their city Nazareth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40 </span>And the child grew, and waxed strong, full of wisdom; and the grace of God was in him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41 </span>And his parents went every year to Jerusalem, at the solemn day of the pasch, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42 </span>And when he was twelve years old, they going up into Jerusalem, according to the custom of the feast, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="43">43 </span>And having fulfilled the days, when they returned, the child Jesus remained in Jerusalem; and his parents knew it not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="44">44 </span>And thinking that he was in the company, they came a day's journey, and sought him among their kinsfolks and acquaintance. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="45">45 </span>And not finding him, they returned into Jerusalem, seeking him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="46">46 </span>And it came to pass, that, after three days, they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, hearing them, and asking them questions. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="47">47 </span>And all that heard him were astonished at his wisdom and his answers. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="48">48 </span>And seeing him, they wondered. And his mother said to him: Son, why hast thou done so to us? behold thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="49">49 </span>And he said to them: How is it that you sought me? did you not know, that I must be about my father's business? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="50">50 </span>And they understood not the word that he spoke unto them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="51">51 </span>And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them. And his mother kept all these words in her heart. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="52">52 </span>And Jesus advanced in wisdom, and age, and grace with God and men. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
