<h3>Chapter 22 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>NOW the feast of unleavened bread, which is called the pasch, was at hand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might put Jesus to death: but they feared the people. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>And Satan entered into Judas, who was surnamed Iscariot, one of the twelve. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And he went, and discoursed with the chief priests and the magistrates, how he might betray him to them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>And he promised. And he sought opportunity to betray him in the absence of the multitude. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>And the day of the unleavened bread came, on which it was necessary that the pasch should be killed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And he sent Peter and John, saying: Go, and prepare for us the pasch, that we may eat. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>But they said: Where wilt thou that we prepare? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>And he said to them: Behold, as you go into the city, there shall meet you a man carrying a pitcher of water: follow him into the house where he entereth in. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And you shall say to the goodman of the house: The master saith to thee, Where is the guest chamber, where I may eat the pasch with my disciples? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And he will shew you a large dining room, furnished; and there prepare. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And they going, found as he had said to them, and made ready the pasch. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And he said to them: With desire I have desired to eat this pasch with you, before I suffer. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>For I say to you, that from this time I will not eat it, till it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And having taken the chalice, he gave thanks, and said: Take, and divide it among you: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>For I say to you, that I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, till the kingdom of God come. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>And taking bread, he gave thanks, and brake; and gave to them, saying: This is my body, which is given for you. Do this for a commemoration of me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>In like manner the chalice also, after he had supped, saying: This is the chalice, the new testament in my blood, which shall be shed for you. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>But yet behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>And the Son of man indeed goeth, according to that which is determined: but yet, woe to that man by whom he shall be betrayed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>And they began to inquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>And there was also a strife amongst them, which of them should seem to be the greater. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>And he said to them: The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and they that have power over them, are called beneficent. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>But you not so: but he that is the greater among you, let him become as the younger; and he that is the leader, as he that serveth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>For which is greater, he that sitteth at table, or he that serveth? Is it not he that sitteth at table? But I am in the midst of you, as he that serveth: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>And you are they who have continued with me in my temptations: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>And I dispose to you, as my Father hath disposed to me, a kingdom; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>That you may eat and drink at my table, in my kingdom: and may sit upon thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>And the Lord said: Simon, Simon, behold Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and thou, being once converted, confirm thy brethren. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>Who said to him: Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34 </span>And he said: I say to thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, till thou thrice deniest that thou knowest me. And he said to them: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35 </span>When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, did you want anything? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36 </span>But they said: Nothing. Then said he unto them: But now he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise a scrip; and he that hath not, let him sell his coat, and buy a sword. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37 </span>For I say to you, that this that is written must yet be fulfilled in me: And with the wicked was he reckoned. For the things concerning me have an end. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38 </span>But they said: Lord, behold here are two swords. And he said to them, It is enough. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39 </span>And going out, he went, according to his custom, to the mount of Olives. And his disciples also followed him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40 </span>And when he was come to the place, he said to them: Pray, lest ye enter into temptation. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41 </span>And he was withdrawn away from them a stone's cast; and kneeling down, he prayed, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42 </span>Saying: Father, if thou wilt, remove this chalice from me: but yet not my will, but thine be done. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="43">43 </span>And there appeared to him an angel from heaven, strengthening him. And being in an agony, he prayed the longer. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="44">44 </span>And his sweat became as drops of blood, trickling down upon the ground. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="45">45 </span>And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="46">46 </span>And he said to them: Why sleep you? arise, pray, lest you enter into temptation. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="47">47 </span>As he was yet speaking, behold a multitude; and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near to Jesus, for to kiss him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="48">48 </span>And Jesus said to him: Judas, dost thou betray the Son of man with a kiss? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="49">49 </span>And they that were about him, seeing what would follow, said to him: Lord, shall we strike with the sword? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="50">50 </span>And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="51">51 </span>But Jesus answering, said: Suffer ye thus far. And when he had touched his ear, he healed him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="52">52 </span>And Jesus said to the chief priests, and magistrates of the temple, and the ancients, that were come unto him: Are ye come out, as it were against a thief, with swords and clubs? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="53">53 </span>When I was daily with you in the temple, you did not stretch forth your hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="54">54 </span>And apprehending him, they led him to the high priest's house. But Peter followed afar off. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="55">55 </span>And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were sitting about it, Peter was in the midst of them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="56">56 </span>Whom when a certain servant maid had seen sitting at the light, and had earnestly beheld him, she said: This man also was with him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="57">57 </span>But he denied him, saying: Woman, I know him not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="58">58 </span>And after a little while, another seeing him, said: Thou also art one of them. But Peter said: O man, I am not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="59">59 </span>And after the space, as it were of one hour, another certain man affirmed, saying: Of a truth, this man was also with him; for he is also a Galilean. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="60">60 </span>And Peter said: Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, as he was yet speaking, the cock crew. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="61">61 </span>And the Lord turning looked on Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, as he had said: Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="62">62 </span>And Peter going out, wept bitterly. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="63">63 </span>And the men that held him, mocked him, and struck him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="64">64 </span>And they blindfolded him, and smote his face. And they asked him, saying: Prophesy, who is it that struck thee? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="65">65 </span>And blaspheming, many other things they said against him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="66">66 </span>And as soon as it was day, the ancients of the people, and the chief priests and scribes, cane together; and they brought him into their council, saying: If thou be the Christ, tell us. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="67">67 </span>And he saith to them: If I shall tell you, you will not believe me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="68">68 </span>And if I shall also ask you, you will not answer me, nor let me go. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="69">69 </span>But hereafter the Son of man shall be sitting on the right hand of the power of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="70">70 </span>Then said they all: Art thou then the Son of God? Who said: You say that I am. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="71">71 </span>And they said: What need we any further testimony? for we ourselves have heard it from his own mouth. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
