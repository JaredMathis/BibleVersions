<h3>Chapter 24 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>AND on the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came to the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And they found the stone rolled back from the sepulchre. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>And going in, they found not the body of the Lord Jesus. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And it came to pass, as they were astonished in their mind at this, behold, two men stood by them, in shining apparel. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>And as they were afraid, and bowed down their countenance towards the ground, they said unto them: Why seek you the living with the dead? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>He is not here, but is risen. Remember how he spoke unto you, when he was in Galilee, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>Saying: The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And they remembered his words. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>And going back from the sepulchre, they told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>And it was Mary Magdalen, and Joanna, and Mary of James, and the other women that were with them, who told these things to the apostles. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And these words seemed to them as idle tales; and they did not believe them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>But Peter rising up, ran to the sepulchre, and stooping down, he saw the linen cloths laid by themselves; and went away wondering in himself at that which was come to pass. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And behold, two of them went, the same day, to a town which was sixty furlongs from Jerusalem, named Emmaus. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>And they talked together of all these things which had happened. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And it came to pass, that while they talked and reasoned with themselves, Jesus himself also drawing near, went with them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>But their eyes were held, that they should not know him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And he said to them: What are these discourses that you hold one with another as you walk, and are sad? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>And the one of them, whose name was Cleophas, answering, said to him: Art thou only a stranger to Jerusalem, and hast not known the things that have been done there in these days? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>To whom he said: What things? And they said: Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet, mighty in work and word before God and all the people; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>And how our chief priests and princes delivered him to be condemned to death, and crucified him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>But we hoped, that it was he that should have redeemed Israel: and now besides all this, to day is the third day since these things were done. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>Yea and certain women also of our company affrighted us, who before it was light, were at the sepulchre, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>And not finding his body, came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, who say that he is alive. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>And some of our people went to the sepulchre, and found it so as the women had said, but him they found not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>Then he said to them: O foolish, and slow of heart to believe in all things which the prophets have spoken. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and so to enter into his glory? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded to them in all the scriptures, the things that were concerning him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>And they drew night to the town, whither they were going: and he made as though he would go farther. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>But they constrained him; saying: Stay with us, because it is towards evening, and the day is now far spent. And he went in with them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>And it came to pass, whilst he was at table with them, he took bread, and blessed, and brake, and gave to them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>And their eyes were opened, and they knew him: and he vanished out of their sight. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>And they said one to the other: Was not our heart burning within us, whilst he spoke in this way, and opened to us the scriptures? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>And rising up, the same hour, they went back to Jerusalem: and they found the eleven gathered together, and those that were staying with them, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34 </span>Saying: The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35 </span>And they told what things were done in the way; and how they knew him in the breaking of the bread. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36 </span>Now whilst they were speaking these things, Jesus stood in the midst of them, and saith to them: Peace be to you; it is I, fear not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37 </span>But they being troubled and frightened, supposed that they saw a spirit. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38 </span>And he said to them: Why are you troubled, and why do thoughts arise in your hearts? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39 </span>See my hands and feet, that it is I myself; handle, and see: for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as you see me to have. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40 </span>And when he had said this, he shewed them his hands and feet. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41 </span>But while they yet believed not, and wondered for joy, he said: Have you any thing to eat? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42 </span>And they offered him a piece of a broiled fish, and a honeycomb. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="43">43 </span>And when he had eaten before them, taking the remains, he gave to them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="44">44 </span>And he said to them: These are the words which I spoke to you, while I was yet with you, that all things must needs be fulfilled, which are written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="45">45 </span>Then he opened their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="46">46 </span>And he said to them: Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise again from the dead, the third day: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="47">47 </span>And that penance and remission of sins should be preached in his name, unto all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="48">48 </span>And you are witnesses of these things. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="49">49 </span>And I send the promise of my Father upon you: but stay you in the city till you be endued with power from on high. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="50">50 </span>And he led them out as far as Bethania: and lifting up his hands, he blessed them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="51">51 </span>And it came to pass, whilst he blessed them, he departed from them, and was carried up to heaven. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="52">52 </span>And they adoring went back into Jerusalem with great joy. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="53">53 </span>And they were always in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
