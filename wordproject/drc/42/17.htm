<h3>Chapter 17 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>AND he said to his disciples: It is impossible that scandals should not come: but woe to him through whom they come. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>It were better for him, that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should scandalize one of these little ones. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>Take heed to yourselves. If thy brother sin against thee, reprove him: and if he do penance, forgive him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And if he sin against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day be converted unto thee, saying, I repent; forgive him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>And the apostles said to the Lord: Increase our faith. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>And the Lord said: If you had faith like to a grain of mustard seed, you might say to this mulberry tree, Be thou rooted up, and be thou transplanted into the sea: and it would obey you. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>But which of you having a servant ploughing, or feeding cattle, will say to him, when he is come from the field: Immediately go, sit down to meat: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And will not rather say to him: Make ready my supper, and gird thyself, and serve me, whilst I eat and drink, and afterwards thou shalt eat and drink? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>Doth he thank that servant, for doing the things which he commanded him? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>I think not. So you also, when you shall have done all these things that are commanded you, say: We are unprofitable servants; we have done that which we ought to do. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And it came to pass, as he was going to Jerusalem, he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And as he entered into a certain town, there met him ten men that were lepers, who stood afar off; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And lifted up their voice, saying: Jesus, master, have mercy on us. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>Whom when he saw, he said: Go, shew yourselves to the priests. And it came to pass, as they went, they were made clean. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And one of them, when he saw that he was made clean, went back, with a loud voice glorifying God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>And he fell on his face before his feet, giving thanks: and this was a Samaritan. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And Jesus answering, said, Were not ten made clean? and where are the nine? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>There is no one found to return and give glory to God, but this stranger. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>And he said to him: Arise, go thy way; for thy faith hath made thee whole. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>And being asked by the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come? he answered them, and said: The kingdom of God cometh not with observation: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>Neither shall they say: Behold here, or behold there. For lo, the kingdom of God is within you. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>And he said to his disciples: The days will come, when you shall desire to see one day of the Son of man; and you shall not see it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>And they will say to you: See here, and see there. Go ye not after, nor follow them: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>For as the lightening that lighteneth from under heaven, shineth unto the parts that are under heaven, so shall the Son of man be in his day. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>But first he must suffer many things, and be rejected by this generation. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>And as it came to pass in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>They did eat and drink, they married wives, and were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark: and the flood came and destroyed them all. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>Likewise as it came to pass, in the days of Lot: they did eat and drink, they bought and sold, they planted and built. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>And in the day that Lot went out of Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man shall be revealed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>In that hour, he that shall be on the housetop, and his goods in the house, let him not go down to take them away: and he that shall be in the field, in like manner, let him not return back. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>Remember Lot's wife. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>Whosoever shall seek to save his life, shall lose it: and whosoever shall lose it, shall preserve it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34 </span>I say to you: in that night there shall be two men in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35 </span>Two women shall be grinding together: the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left: two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be keft. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36 </span>They answering, say to him: Where, Lord? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37 </span>Who said to them: Wheresoever the body shall be, thither will the eagles also be gathered together. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
