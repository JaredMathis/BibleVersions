<h3>Chapter 18 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>AND he spoke also a parable to them, that we ought always to pray, and not to faint, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>Saying: There was a judge in a certain city, who feared not God, nor regarded man. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>And there was a certain widow in that city, and she came to him, saying: Avenge me of my adversary. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And he would not for a long time. But afterwards he said within himself: Although I fear not God, nor regard man, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>Yet because this widow is troublesome to me, I will avenge her, lest continually coming she weary me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>And the Lord said: Hear what the unjust judge saith. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>And will not God revenge his elect who cry to him day and night: and will he have patience in their regard? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>I say to you, that he will quickly revenge them. But yet the Son of man, when he cometh, shall he find, think you, faith on earth? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>And to some who trusted in themselves as just, and despised others, he spoke also this parable: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>Two men went up into the temple to pray: the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>The Pharisee standing, prayed thus with himself: O God, I give thee thanks that I am not as the rest of men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, as also is this publican. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>I fast twice in a week: I give tithes of all that I possess. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And the publican, standing afar off, would not so much as lift up his eyes towards heaven; but struck his breast, saying: O god, be merciful to me a sinner. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>I say to you, this man went down into his house justified rather that the other: because every one that exalteth himself, shall be humbled: and he that humbleth himself, shall be exalted. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And they brought unto him also infants, that he might touch them. Which when the disciples saw, they rebuked them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>But Jesus, calling them together, said: Suffer children to come to me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>Amen, I say to you: Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a child, shall not enter into it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>And a certain ruler asked him, saying: Good master, what shall I do to possess everlasting life? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>And Jesus said to him: Why dost thou call me good? None is good but God alone. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>Thou knowest the commandments: Thou shalt not kill: Thou shalt not commit adultery: Thou shalt not steal: Thou shalt not bear false witness: Honour thy father and mother. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>Who said: All these things have I kept from my youth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>Which when Jesus had heard, he said to him: Yet one thing is wanting to thee: sell all whatever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>He having heard these things, became sorrowful; for he was very rich. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>And Jesus seeing him become sorrowful, said: How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>For it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>And they that heard it, said: Who then can be saved? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>He said to them: The things that are impossible with men, are possible with God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>Then Peter said: Behold, we have left all things, and have followed thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>Who said to them: Amen, I say to you, there is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>Who shall not receive much more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>Then Jesus took unto him the twelve, and said to them: Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things shall be accomplished which were written by the prophets concerning the Son of man. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>For he shall be delivered to the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and scourged, and spit upon: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>And after they have scourged him, they will put him to death; and the third day he shall rise again. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34 </span>And they understood none of these things, and this word was hid from them, and they understood not the things that were said. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35 </span>Now it came to pass, when he drew nigh to Jericho, that a certain blind man sat by the way side, begging. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36 </span>And when he heard the multitude passing by, he asked what this meant. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37 </span>And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38 </span>And he cried out, saying: Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39 </span>And they that went before, rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried out much more: Son of David, have mercy on me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40 </span>And Jesus standing, commanded him to be brought unto him. And when he was come near, he asked him, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41 </span>Saying: What wilt thou that I do to thee? But he said: Lord, that I may see. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42 </span>And Jesus said to him: Receive thy sight: thy faith hath made thee whole. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="43">43 </span>And immediately he saw, and followed him, glorifying God. And all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
