<h3>Chapter 16 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>AND he said also to his disciples: There was a certain rich man who had a steward: and the same was accused unto him, that he had wasted his goods. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And he called him, and said to him: How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship: for now thou canst be steward no longer. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>And the steward said within himself: What shall I do, because my lord taketh away from me the stewardship? To dig I am not able; to beg I am ashamed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>I know what I will do, that when I shall be removed from the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>Therefore calling together every one of his lord's debtors, he said to the first: How much dost thou owe my lord? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>But he said: An hundred barrels of oil. And he said to him: Take thy bill and sit down quickly, and write fifty. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>Then he said to another: And how much dost thou owe? Who said: An hundred quarters of wheat. He said to him: Take thy bill, and write eighty. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And the lord commended the unjust steward, forasmuch as he had done wisely: for the children of this world are wiser in their generation than the children of light. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>And I say to you: Make unto you friends of the mammon of iniquity; that when you shall fail, they may receive you into everlasting dwellings. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>He that is faithful in that which is least, is faithful also in that which is greater: and he that is unjust in that which is little, is unjust also in that which is greater. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>If then you have not been faithful in the unjust mammon; who will trust you with that which is the true? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And if you have not been faithful in that which is another's; who will give you that which is your own? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or he will hold to the one, and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>Now the Pharisees, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And he said to them: You are they who justify yourselves before men, but God knoweth your hearts; for that which is high to men, is an abomination before God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>The law and the prophets were until John; from that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every one useth violence towards it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fall. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>Every one that putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and he that marrieth her that is put away from her husband, commmitteth adultery. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>There was a certain rich man, who was clothed in purple and fine linen; and feasted sumptuously every day. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>And there was a certain beggar, named Lazarus, who lay at his gate, full of sores, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>Desiring to be filled with the crumbs that fell from the rich man's table, and no one did give him; moreover the dogs came, and licked his sores. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom. And the rich man also died: and he was buried in hell. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>And lifting up his eyes when he was in torments, he saw Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>And he cried, and said: Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, to cool my tongue: for I am tormented in this flame. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>And Abraham said to him: Son, remember that thou didst receive good things in thy lifetime, and likewise Lazareth evil things, but now he is comforted; and thou art tormented. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>And besides all this, between us and you, there is fixed a great chaos: so that they who would pass from hence to you, cannot, nor from thence come hither. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>And he said: Then, father, I beseech thee, that thou wouldst send him to my father's house, for I have five brethren, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>That he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torments. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>And Abraham said to him: They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>But he said: No, father Abraham: but if one went to them from the dead, they will do penance. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>And he said to him: If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they believe, if one rise again from the dead. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
