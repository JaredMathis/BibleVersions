<h3>Chapter 39 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>And Joseph was brought into Egypt, and Putiphar an eunuch of Pharao, chief captain of the army, an Egyptian, bought him of the Ismaelites, by whom he was brought. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And the Lord was with him, and he was a prosperous man in all things: and he dwelt in his master's house, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>Who knew very well that the Lord was with him, and made all that he did to prosper in his hand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And Joseph found favour in the sight of his master, and ministered to him: and being set over all by him, he governed the house committed to him, and all things that were delivered to him: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>And the Lord blessed the house of the Egyptian for Joseph's sake, and multiplied all his substance, both at home, and in the fields. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>Neither knew he any other thing, but the bread which he ate. And Joseph was of a beautiful countenance, and comely to behold. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>h And after many days his mistress 'cast her eyes on Joseph, and said: Lie with me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>But he, in no wise consenting to that wicked act, said to her: Behold, my master hath delivered all things to me, and knoweth not what he hath in his own house: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>Neither is there any thing which is hot in my power, or that he hath not delivered to me, but thee, who art his wife : how then can I do this wicked thing, and I sin against my God? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>With such words as these day by day, both the woman was importunate with the young man, and he refused the adultery. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>Now it happened on it certain day, that Joseph went into the house, and was doing some business without any, man with him: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And she catching the skirt of his garment, said: Lie with me. But he leaving the garment in her hand, fled, and went out. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And when the woman saw the garment in her hands, and herself disregarded, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>She called to her the men of her house, and said to them: See, he hath brought in a Hebrew, to abuse us: he came in to me, to lie with me : and when I cried out, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And he heard my voice, he left the garment that I held, and got him out. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>For a proof therefore of her fidelity, she kept the garment, and shewed it to her husband when he returned home: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And said: The Hebrew servant, whom thou best brought, came to me to abuse me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>And when he heard me cry, he left the garment which I held, and fled out. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>His master hearing these things, and giving too much credit to his wife's words, was very angry. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>And cast Joseph into the prison, where the king's prisoners were kept, and he was there shut up. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>But the Lord was with Joseph and having mercy upon him gave him favour in the sight of the chief keeper of the prison: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>Who delivered into his hand all the prisoners that were kept in custody: and whatsoever was done was under him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>Neither did he himself know any thing, having committed all things to him: for the Lord was with him, and made all that he did to prosper. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
