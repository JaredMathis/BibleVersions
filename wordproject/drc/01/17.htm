<h3>Chapter 17 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>And after he began to be ninety and nine years old, the Lord appeared to him: and said unto him: I am the Almighty God: walk before me, and be perfect. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And I will make my covenant between me and thee: and I will multiply thee exceedingly. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>Abram tell flat on his face. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And God said to him: I AM, and my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father. of many nations. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>Neither shall thy name be called any more Abram: but thou shalt be called Abraham: because I have made thee a father of many nations. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>And I will make thee increase, exceedingly, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>And I will establish my covenant between me and thee, and between thy sad after thee in their generations, by a perpetual covenant: to be a God to thee, and to thy seed after thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And I will give to thee, and to thy seed, the land of thy sojournment, all the land of Chanaan for a perpetual possession, and I will be their God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>Again God said to Abraham: And thou therefore shalt keep my covenant, and thy seed after thee in their generations. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>This is my covenant which you shall observe, between me and you, and thy seed after thee: All the male kind of you shall be circumcised: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And you shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin, that it may be for a h sign of the covenant between me and you. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>An infant of eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations: he that is born in the house, as well as the bought servant shall be circumcised, and whosoever is not of your stock: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And my covenant shall be in your flesh for a perpetual covenant. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>The male, whose dash of his foreskin shall not be circumcised, that soul shall be destroyed out of his people: because he hath broken my covenant. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>God said also to Abraham: Sarai thy wife thou shalt not call Sarai, but Sara. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>And I will bless her, and of her I will give thee a son, whom I will bless, and he shell become nations, and kings of people shall spring from him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, saying in his heart: Shall a son, thinkest thou, be born to him that is a hundred years old? and shall Sara that is ninety years old bring forth? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>And he said to God: O that Ismael may live before thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>And God said to Abraham: Sara thy wife shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name Isaac, and I will establish my covenant with him for a perpetual covenant, and with his seed after him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>And as for Ismael I have also heard thee. Behold, I will bless him, and increase, and multiply him exceedingly: he shall beget twelve chiefs, and I will make him a great nation. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>But my covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sara shall bring forth to thee at this time in the next year. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>And when he had left oil speaking with him, God went up from Abraham. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>And Abraham took Ismael his son, and all that were born in his house: and all whom he had bought, every male among the men of his house: and he circumcised the flesh of their foreskin forthwith the very same day, as God had commanded him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>Abraham was ninety and nine years old, when he circumcised the flesh of his foreskin. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>And Ismael his son was full thirteen years old at the time of his circumcision. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>The selfsame day was Abraham circumcised and Ismael his son. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>And all the men of his house, as well they that were born in his house, as the bought servants and strangers were circumcised with him. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
