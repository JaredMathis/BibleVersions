<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>And Jacob called his sons, and said to them: Gather yourselves together that I may tell you the things that shall befall you in the last days. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>Gather yourselves together, and hear, O ye sons of Jacob, hearken to Israel your father: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>Ruben, my firstborn, thou art my strength, and the beginning of my sorrow: excelling in gifts, greater in command. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>Thou art poured out as water, grow thou not: because thou wentest up to thy father's bed, and didst defile his couch. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>Simeon and Levi brethren: vessels of iniquity, waging war. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>Let not my soul go into their counsel, nor my glory be in their assembly: "be- cause in their fury they slew a man, and in their selfwill they undermined a wall. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>Cursed be their fury, because it was stubborn: and their wrath because it was cruel: I Will divide them in Jacob, and will scatter them in Israel. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>Juda, thee shall thy brethren praise: thy hands shall be on the necks of thy enemies: the sons of thy father shall bow down to thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>Juda is a lion's whelp: to the prey, my son, thou art gone up: resting thou hast couched as a lion, and as a lioness, who shall rouse him? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>The sceptre shall not be taken away from Juda, nor a ruler from his thigh, till he come that is to be sent, and he shall be the expectation of nations. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>ying his foal to the vineyard, and his ass, 0 my son, to the vine. He shall wash his robe in wine, and his garment in the blood of the grape. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>His eyes are more beautiful than wine, and his teeth whiter than milk. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>Zabulon shall dwell on the sea shore, and in the road of ships, reaching as far as Sidon. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>Issachar shall be a strong ass lying down between the borders. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>He saw rest that it was good: and the land that it was excellent: and he bowed his shoulder to carry, and became a servant under tribute. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>Dan shall judge his people like an- other tribe in Israel. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>Let Dan be a snake in the way, a serpent in the path, that biteth the horse's heels that his rider may fall backward. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>I will look for thy salvation, 0 Lord. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>Gad, being girded, shall fight before him: and he himself shall be girded backward. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>Aser, his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield dainties to kings. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>Nephtali, a hart let loose, and giving words of beauty. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>Joseph is a growing son, a growing son and comely to behold; the daughters run to and fro upon the wall. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>But they that held darts provoked him, and quarrelled with him, and envied him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>His bow rested upon the strong, and the bands of his arms and his hands were loosed, by the hands of the mighty one of Jacob: thence he came forth a pastor, the stone of Israel. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>The God of thy father shall be thy helper, and the Almighty shall bless thee with the blessings of heaven above, with the blessings of the deep that lieth be- neath, with the blessings of the breasts and of the womb. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>The blessings of thy father are strengthened with the blessings of his fathers: until the desire of the everlasting hills should come; may they be upon the head of Joseph, and upon the crown of the Nazarite among his brethren. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>Benjamin a ravenous wolf, in the morning shall eat the prey, and in the evening shall divide the spoil. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: these things their father spoke to them, and he blessed every one, with their proper blessings. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>And he charged them, saying: I am now going to be gathered to my people : bury me with my fathers in the double cave, which is in the field of Ephron the Hethite, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>Over against Mambre in the land of Chanaan, which Abraham bought to- gather with the field of Ephron the Hethite for a possession to bury in. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>There they buried him, and Sara his wife: there was Isaac buried with Rebecca his wife: there also Lia doth lie buried. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>- - - 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>And when he had ended the commandments, wherewith he instructed his sons, he drew up his feet upon the bed, and died: and he was gathered to his people." </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
