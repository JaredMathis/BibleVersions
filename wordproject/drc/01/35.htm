<h3>Chapter 35 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>In the meantime God said to Jacob: Arise, and go up to Bethel, and dwell there, and make there an altar to God, who appeared to thee when thou didst flee from Esau thy brother. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And Jacob having called together all his household, said: Cast away the strange gods that are among you, and be cleansed and change your garments. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>Arise, and let us go up to Bethel, that we may make there an altar to God: who heard me in the day of my affliction, and accompanied me in my journey. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>So they gave him all the strange gods they had, and the earrings which were in their ears: and he buried them under the turpentine tree, that is behind the city of Sichem. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>And when they were departed, the terror of God fell upon all the cities round about, and they durst not pursue after them as they went away. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>And Jacob came to Luza, which is in the land of Chanaan, surnamed Bethel: he and all the people that were with him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>And he built there an altar, and called the name of that place, The house of God: for there God appeared to him when he fled from his brother. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>At the same time Debora the nurse of Rebecca died, and was buried at the foot of Bethel under an oak: and the name of that place was called, The oak of weeping. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>And God appeared again to Jacob, after he returned from Mesopotamia of Syria, and he blessed him, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>Saying: Thou shalt not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name. And he called him Israel. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And said to him: I am God Almighty, increase thou and be multiplied. Nations and peoples of nations shall be from thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And the land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac, I will give to thee, and to thy seed after thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And he departed from him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>But he set up a monument of stone, in the place where God had spoken to him: pouring drink offerings upon it, and pouring oil thereon: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And calling the name of that place Bethel. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>And going forth from thence, he came in the springtime to the land which leadeth to Ephrata: wherein when Rachel was in travail, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>By reason of her hard labor she began to be in danger, and the midwife said to her: Fear not, for thou shalt have this son also. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>And when her soul was departing for pain, and death was now at hand, she called the name of her son Benoni, that is, The son of my pain: but his father called him Benjamin, that is, The son of the right hand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>So Rachel died, and was buried in the highway that leadeth to Ephrata, that is Bethlehem. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>And Jacob erected a pillar over her sepulcher: this is the pillar of Rachel's monument, to this day. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>Departing thence, he pitched his tent beyond the Flock tower. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>And when he dwelt in that country, Ruben went, and slept with Bala, the concubine of his father: which he was not ignorant of. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>The sons of Lia: Ruben the firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Juda, and Issachar, and Zebulon. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>The sons of Bala, Rachel's handmaid: Dan and Naphthali. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>The sons of Zelpha, Lia's handmaid: Gad and Aser: these are the sons of Jacob, that were born to him in Mesopotamia of Syria. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>And he came to Isaac his father in Mambre, the city of Arbee, this is Hebron: Wherein Abraham and Isaac sojourned. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>And the days of Isaac were a hundred and eighty years. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>And being spent with age he died, and was gathered to his people, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
