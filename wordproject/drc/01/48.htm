<h3>Chapter 48 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>After these things, it was told Joseph that his father was sick: and he set out to go to him, taking his two sons Manasses and Ephraim. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And it was told the old man: Behold I thy son Joseph cometh to thee. And being strengthened he sat on his bed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>And when Joseph was come in to him, he said : God Almighty appeared to me at Lute, which is in the land of Chanaan: and he blessed me, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And he said : I will cause thee to increase and multiply, and I will make of thee a multitude of people: and I will give this land to thee, and to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>So thy two sons who were born to thee in the land of Egypt before I came hither to thee, shall be mine: Ephraim and Manasses shall be reputed to me as Ruben and Simeon. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>But the rest whom thou shalt have after them, shall be thine, and shall be called by the name of their brethren in their possessions. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>For, when I came out of Mesopotamia, Rachel died from me in the land of Ohanaan in the very journey, and it was springtime: and I was going to Ephrata, and I buried her near the way of Ephrata, which by another name is called Bethlehem. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>Then seeing his sons, he said to him: Who are these? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>He answered: They are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place. And he said: Bring them to me that I may bless them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>For Israel's eyes were dim by reason of his great age, and he could not see clearly. And when they were brought to him, he kissed and embraced them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And said to his son: I am not deprived of seeing thee: moreover God hath shewed me thy seed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And when Joseph had taken them from his father's lap, he bowed down with his face to the ground. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And he set Ephraim on his right bend, that is, towards the left hand of Israel; but Manasses on his left hand, to wit, towards his father's right hand, and brought them near to him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>But he stretching forth his right hand, put it upon the head of Ephraim the younger brother; and the left upon the head of Manasses who was the elder, changing his hands. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And Jacob blessed the sons of Joseph, and said: God, in whose sight my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, God that feedeth me from my youth until this day; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>The angel that delivereth me from all evils, bless these boys: and let my name be called upon them, and the names of my fathers Abraham, and Isaac, and may they grow into a multitude upon the earth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And Joseph seeing that his father had put his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, was much displeased: and taking his father's hand he tried to lift it from Ephraims head, and to remove it to the head of Manasses. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>And he said to his father: It should not be so, my father: for this is the first- born, put thy right hand upon his head. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>But he refusing, said: I know, my son, I know: and this also shall become peoples, and shall be multiplied: but this younger brother shall be greater than he: and his seed shall grow into nations. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>And he blessed them at that time, saying: In thee shall Israel be blessed, and it shall be said: God do to thee as to Ephraim, and as to Manasses. And he set Ephraim before Manasses. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>And he said to Joseph his son: Be- hold I die, and God will be with you, and will bring you back into the land of your fathers. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>I give thee a portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorrhite a with my sword and bow. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
