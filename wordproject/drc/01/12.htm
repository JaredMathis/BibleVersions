<h3>Chapter 12 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>And the Lord said to Abram: Go forth out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and out of they father's house, and come into the land which I shall shew thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and magnify thy name, and thou shalt be blessed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>I will bless them that bless thee, and curse them that curse thee, and IN THEE shall all the kindred of the earth be blessed: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>So Abram went out as the Lord had commanded him, and Lot went with him: Abram was seventy-five years old when he went forth from Haran. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>And he took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all the substance which they had gathered, and the souls which they had gotten in Haran: and they went out to go into the land of Chanaan. And when they were come into it, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>Abram passed through the country into the place of Sichem, as far as the noble vale: now the Chanaanite was at that time in the land. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>And the Lord appeared to Abram, and said to him: To thy seed will I give this land. And he built there an altar to the Lord, who had appeared to him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And passing on from thence to a mountain, that was on the east side of Bethel, he there pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east; he built there also an altar to the Lord, and called upon his name. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>And Abram went forward, going, and proceeding on to the south. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>And there came a famine in the country; and Abram went down into Egypt, to sojourn there: for the famine was very grievous in the land. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And when he was near to enter into Egypt, he said to Sarai his wife: I know that thou art a beautiful woman: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And that when the Egyptians shall see thee, they will say: She is his wife: and they will kill me, and keep thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>Say, therefore, I pray thee, that thou art my sister: that I may be well used for thee, and that my soul may live for thy sake. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>And when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians saw the woman that she was very beautiful. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And the princes told Pharao, and praised her before him: and the woman was taken into the house of Pharao. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>And they used Abram well for her sake. And he had sheep and oxen, and he asses, and menservants and maidservants, and she asses, and camels. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>But the Lord scourged Pharao and his house with most grievous stripes for Sarai, Abram's wife. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>And Pharao called Abram, and said to him: What is this that thou hast done to me? Why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>For what cause didst thou say, she was thy sister, that I might take her to my wife? Now therefore, there is thy wife, take her, and go thy way. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>And Pharao gave his men orders concerning Abram: and they led him away, and his wife, and all that he had. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
