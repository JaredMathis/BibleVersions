<h3>Chapter 25 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>And Abraham married another wife, named Cetura: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>Who bore to him Zamran, and Jecsan, and Madan, and Madian, and Jesboc, and Sue. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>Jecsan also begot Saba and Dadan. The children of Dadan were Assurim, and Latusim, and Loomin. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>But of Madian was born Epha, and Opher, and Henoch, and Abida, and Eldaa: all these were the children of Cetura. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>And Abraham gave all his possessions to Isaac. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>And to the children of the concubines he gave gifts, and separated them from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, to the east country. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>And the days of Abraham's life were a hundred and seventy-five years. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And decaying he died in a good old age, and having lived a long time, and being full of days: and was gathered to his people. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>And Isaac and Ismael his sons buried him in the double cave, which was situated in the field of Ephron the son of Seor the Hethite, over against Mambre; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>Which he had bought of the children of Heth: there was he buried, and Sara his wife. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And after his death, God blessed Isaac his son, who dwelt by the well named Of the living and seeing. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>These are the generations of Ismael the son of Abraham, whom Agar the Egyptian, Sara's servant, bore unto him: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And these are the names of his children according to their calling and generations. The firstborn of Ismael was Nabajoth, then Cedar, and Adbeel, and Mabsam. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>And Masma, and Duma, and Massa, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>Hadar, and Thema, and Jethur, and Naphis, and Cedma. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>These are the sons of Ismael: and these are their names by their castles and towns, twelve princes of their tribes. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And the years of Ismael's life were a hundred and thirty-seven, and decaying he died, and was gathered unto his people. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>And he dwelt from Hevila as far as Sur, which looketh towards Egypt, to them that go towards the Assyrians. He died in the presence of all his brethren. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>These also are the generations of Isaac the son of Abraham: Abraham begot Isaac: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>Who when he was forty years old, took to wife Rebecca the daughter of Bathuel the Syrian of Mesopotamia, sister to Laban. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>And Isaac besought the Lord for his wife, because she was barren; and he heard him, and made Rebecca to conceive. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>But the children struggled in her womb: and she said: If it were to be so with me, what need was there to conceive? And she went to consult the Lord. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>And he answering said: Two nations are in thy womb, and two peoples shall be divided out of thy womb, and one people shall overcome the other, and the elder shall serve the younger. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>And when her time was come to be delivered, behold twins were found in her womb. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>He that came forth first was red, and hairy like a skin: and his name was called Esau. Immediately the other coming forth, held his brother's foot in his hand, and therefore he was called Jacob. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>Isaac was threescore years old when the children were born unto him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>And when they were grown up, Esau became a skillful hunter, and a husbandman, but Jacob a plain man dwelt in tents. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>Isaac loved Esau, because he ate of his hunting: and Rebecca loved Jacob. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>And Jacob boiled Pottage: to whom Esau, coming faint out of the field, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>Said: Give me of this red pottage, for I am exceeding faint. For which reason his name was called Edom. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>And Jacob said to him: Sell me thy first birthright. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>He answered: Lo I die, what will the first birthright avail me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>Jacob said: Swear therefore to me. Esau swore to him, and sold his first birthright. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34 </span>And so taking bread and the pottage of lentils, he ate, and drank, and went his way; making little account of having sold his first birthright. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
