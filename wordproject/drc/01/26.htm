<h3>Chapter 26 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>And when a famine came in the land, after that barrenness which had happened in the days of Abraham, Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Palestines to Gerara. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And the Lord appeared to him and said: Go not down into Egypt, but stay in the land that I shall tell thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>And sojourn in it, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee: for to thee and to thy seed I will give all these countries, to fulfill the oath which I swore to Abraham thy father. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And I will multiply thy seed like the stars of heaven: and I will give to thy posterity all these countries: and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>Because Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my precepts and commandments, and observed my ceremonies and laws. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>So Isaac abode in Gerara. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>And when he was asked by the men of that place, concerning his wife, he answered: She is my sister; for he was afraid to confess that she was his wife, thinking lest perhaps they would like him because of her beauty. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And when very many days were passed, and he abode there, Abimelech king of the Palestines looking out through a window, saw him playing with Rebecca his wife. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>And calling for him, he said: It is evident she is thy wife: why didst thou feign her to be thy sister? He answered: I feared lest I should die for her sake. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>And Abimelech said: Why hadst thou deceived us? Some man of the people might have lain with thy wife, and thou hadst brought upon us a great sin. And he commanded all the people, saying: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>He that shall touch this man's wife, shall surely be put to death. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And Isaac sowed in that land, and he found that same year a hundredfold: and the Lord blessed him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And the man was enriched, and he went on prospering and increasing, till he became exceeding great: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>And he had possessions of sheep and of herds, and a very great family. Wherefore the Palestines envying him, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>Stopped up at that time all the wells, that the servants of his father Abraham had digged, filling them up with earth: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>Insomuch that Abimelech himself said to Isaac: Depart from us, for thou art become much mightier than we. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>So he departed and came to the torrent of Gerara, to dwell there: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>And he digged again other wells, which the servants of his father Abraham had digged, and which, after his death, the Palestines had of old stopped up: and he called them by the same names by which his father before had called them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>And they digged in the torrent, and found living water. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>But there also the herdsmen of Gerara strove against the herdsmen of Isaac, saying: It is our water. Wherefore he called the name of the well, on occasion of that which had happened, Calumny. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>And they digged also another; and for that they quarreled likewise, and he called the name of it, Enmity. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>Going forward from thence, he digged another well, for which they contended not: therefore he called the name thereof, Latitude, saying: Now hath the Lord given us room, and made us to increase upon the earth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>And he went up from that place to Bersabee, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>Where the Lord appeared to him that same might, saying: I am the God of Abraham thy father; do not fear, for I am with thee: I will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>And he built there an altar: and called upon the name of the Lord, and pitched his tent: and commanded his servants to dig a well. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>To which place when Abimelech, and Ochozath his friend, and Phicol chief captain of his soldiers came from Gerara, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>Isaac said to them: Why are ye come to me, a man whom you hate, and have thrust out from you? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>And they answered: We saw that the Lord is with thee, and therefore we said: Let there be an oath between us, and let us make a covenant, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>That thou do us no harm, as we on our part have touched nothing of thine, nor have done any thing to hurt thee: but with peace have sent thee away increased with the blessing of the Lord. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>And he made them a feast, and after they had eaten and drunk: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>Arising in the morning, they swore one to another: and Isaac sent them away peaceably to their own home. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>And behold the same day the servants of Isaac came, telling him of a well which they had digged, and saying: We have found water. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>Whereupon he called it Abundance: and the name of the city was called Bersabee, even to this day. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34 </span>And Esau being forty years old, married wives, Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hethite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon of the same place. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35 </span>And they both offended the mind of Isaac and Rebecca. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
