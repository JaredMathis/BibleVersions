<h3>Chapter 37 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>And Jacob dwelt in the land of Chanaan wherein his father sojourned. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And these are his generations: Joseph, when he was sixteen years old, was feeding the dock with his brethren, being but a boy: and he was with the sons of and of Zelpha his father's wives : and he accused his brethren to his father of a most wicked crime. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>Now Israel loved Joseph above all his sons, because he had him in his old age: and he made him a coat of divers colours. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And his brethren seeing that he was loved by his father, more than all his sons, hated him, and could not speak peaceably to him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>Now it fell out also that he told his brethren a dream, that he had dreamed: which occasioned them to hate him the more. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>And he said to them: Hear my dream which I dreamed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>I thought we were binding sheaves in the field: and my sheaf arose as it were, end stood, and your sheaves standing about, bowed down before my sheaf. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>His brethren answered : Shalt thou be our king? or shall we be subject to thy dominion? Therefore this matter of his dreams and words ministered nourishment to their envy and hatred. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>He dreamed also another dream, which he told his brethren, saying: I saw in a dream, as it were the sun, and the moon, and eleven stars worshipping me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>And when he had told this to his father and brethren, his father rebuked him, and said: What meaneth this dream that thou hast dreamed? shall I and thy mother, and thy brethren worship thee upon the earth? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>His brethren therefore envied him: but his father considered the thing with himself. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And when his brethren abode in Sichem feeding their father's docks, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>Israel said to him : Thy brethren feed the sheep in Sichem: come, I will send thee to them. And when he answered: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>I am ready: he said to him: Go, and see if all things be well with thy brethren, and the cattle: and bring me word again what is doing. So being sent from the vale of Hebron, he came to Sichem: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And a man found him there wandering in the field, and asked what he sought. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>But he answered: I seek my brethren; tell me where they feed the docks. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And the man said to him: They are departed from this place: for I heard them say: Let us go to Dothain. And Joseph went forward after his brethren, and found them in Dothain. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>And when they saw him afar off, be- fore he came nigh them, they thought to kill him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>And said one to another: Behold the dreamer cometh. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>Come, let us kill him, and cast him into some old pit : and we will say : Some evil beast hath devoured him: and then it shall appear what his dreams avail him : 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>And Ruben hearing this, endeavoured to deliver him out of their hands, end said: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>Do not take away his life, nor shed his blood: but cast him into this pit, that is in the wilderness, and keep your hands harmless: now he said this, being desirous to deliver him out of their hands and to restore him to his father. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>And as soon as he came to his brethren, they forthwith stript him of his outside coat, that was of divers colours: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>And cast him into an old pit, where there was no water. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>And sitting down to eat bread, they saw some Ismaelites on their way coming from Calaad, with their camels, carrying spices, and balm, and myrrh to Egypt. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>And Juda said to his brethren: What will it profit us to kill our brother, and conceal his blood? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>It is better that he be sold to the Ismaelites, and that our hands be not defiled: for he is our brother and our flesh. His brethren agreed to his words. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>And when the Madianite merchants passed by, they drew him out of the pit, and sold him to the Ismaelites, for twenty pieces of silver: and they led him into Egypt. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>And Ruben, returning to the pit, found not the boy: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>And rending his garments he went to his brethren, and said: The boy doth not appear and whither shall I go? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>And they took his coat, and dipped it in the blood of a kid, which they had killed : 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>Sending some to carry it to their father, and to say: This we have found: see whether it be thy son's coat, or not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>And the father acknowledging it, said: It is my son's coat, an evil wild beast hath eaten him, a beast hath devoured Joseph. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34 </span>And tearing his garments, he put an sackcloth, mourning for his son a long time. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35 </span>And alibis children being gathered together to comfort their father in his sorrow, he would not receive comfort, but said: I will go down to my son into hell, mourning. And whilst he continued weeping, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36 </span>The Madianites sold Joseph in Egypt to Putiphar, an eunuch of Pharao, captain of the soldiers. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
