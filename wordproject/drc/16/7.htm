<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>Now after the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and numbered the porters and singing men, and Levites: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>I commanded Hanani my brother, and Hananias ruler of the house of Jerusalem, (for he seemed as a sincere man, and one that feared God above the rest,) 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>And I said to them: Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened till the sun be hot. And while they were yet standing by, the gates were shut, and barred: and I set watchmen of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one by their courses, and every mall over against his house. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And the city was very wide and great, and the people few in the midst thereof, and the houses were not built. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>But God had put in my heart, and I assembled the princes and magistrates, and common people, to number them: and I found a book of the number of them who came up at first, and therein it was found written: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>These are the children of the province, who came up from the captivity of them that had been carried away, whom Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon had carried away, and who returned into Judea, every one into his own city.
