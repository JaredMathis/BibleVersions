<h3>Psalm 119 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the Lord. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>Blessed are they who search his testimonies: that seek him with their whole heart. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>For they that work iniquity, have not walked in his ways. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>Thou hast commanded thy commandments to be kept most diligently. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>O! that my ways may be directed to keep thy justifications. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>Then shall I not be confounded, when I shall look into all thy commandments. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall have learned the judgments of thy justice. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>I will keep thy justifications: O! do not thou utterly forsake me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>By what doth a young man correct his way? by observing thy words. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>With my whole heart have I sought after thee: let me not stray from thy commandments. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>Thy words have I hidden in my heart, that I may not sin against thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>Blessed art thou, O Lord: teach me thy justifications. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>With my lips I have pronounced all the judgments of thy mouth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>I have been delighted in the way of thy testimonies, as in all riches. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>I will meditate on thy commandments: and I will consider thy ways. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>I will think of thy justifications: I will not forget thy words. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>Give bountifully to thy servant, enliven me: and I shall keep thy words. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>Open thou my eyes: and I will consider the wondrous things of thy law. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>I am a sojourner on the earth: hide not thy commandments from me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>My soul hath coveted to long for thy justifications, at all times. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>Thou hast rebuked the proud: they are cursed who decline from thy commandments. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>Remove from reproach and contempt: because I have sought after thy testimonies. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>For princes sat, and spoke against me: but thy servant was employed in thy justifications. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>For thy testimonies are my meditation: and thy justifications my counsel. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>My soul hath cleaved to the pavement: quicken thou me according to thy word. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>I have declared my ways, and thou hast heard me: tech me thy justifications. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>Make me to understand the way of thy justifications: and I shall be exercised in thy wondrous works. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>My soul hath slumbered through heaviness: strengthen thou me in thy words. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>Remove from me the way of iniquity: and out of thy law have mercy on me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>I have chosen the way of truth: thy judgments I have not forgotten. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>I have stuck to thy testimonies, O Lord: put me not to shame. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>I have run the way of thy commandments, when thou didst enlarge my heart. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>Set before me for a law the way of thy justifications, O Lord: and I will always seek after it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34 </span>Give me understanding, and I will search thy law ; and I will keep it with my whole heart. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35 </span>Lead me into the path of thy commandments; for this same I have desired. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36 </span>Incline my heart into thy testimonies and not to covetousness. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37 </span>Turn away my eyes that they may not behold vanity: quicken me in thy way. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38 </span>Establish thy word to thy servant, in thy fear. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39 </span>Turn away my reproach, which I have apprehended: for thy judgments are delightful. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40 </span>Behold I have longed after thy precepts: quicken me in thy justice. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41 </span>Let thy mercy also come upon me, O Lord: thy salvation according to thy word. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42 </span>So shall I answer them that reproach me in any thing; that I have trusted in thy words. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="43">43 </span>And take not thou the word of truth utterly out of my mouth: for in thy words have I hoped exceedingly. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="44">44 </span>So shall I always keep thy law, for ever and ever. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="45">45 </span>And I walked at large: because I have sought after thy commandments. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="46">46 </span>And I spoke of thy testimonies before kings: and I was not ashamed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="47">47 </span>I meditated also on thy commandments, which I loved. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="48">48 </span>And I lifted up my hands to thy commandments, which I loved: and I was exercised in thy justifications. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="49">49 </span>Be thou mindful of thy word to thy servant, in which thou hast given me hope. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="50">50 </span>This hath comforted me in my humiliation: because thy word hath enlivened me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="51">51 </span>The proud did iniquitously altogether: but I declined not from thy law. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="52">52 </span>I remembered, O Lord, thy judgments of old: and I was comforted. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="53">53 </span>A fainting hath taken hold of me, because of the wicked that forsake thy law. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="54">54 </span>Thy justifications were the subject of my song, in the place of my pilgrimage. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="55">55 </span>In the night I have remembered thy name, O Lord: and have kept thy law. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="56">56 </span>This happened to me: because I sought after thy justifications. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="57">57 </span>O Lord, my portion, I have said, I would keep the law. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="58">58 </span>I entreated thy face with all my heart: have mercy on me according to thy word. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="59">59 </span>I have thought on my ways: and turned my feet unto thy testimonies. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="60">60 </span>I am ready, and am not troubled: that I may keep thy commandments. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="61">61 </span>The cords of the wicked have encompassed me: but I have not forgotten thy law. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="62">62 </span>I rose at midnight to give praise to thee; for the judgments of thy justification. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="63">63 </span>I am a partaker with all them that fear thee, and that keep thy commandments. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="64">64 </span>The earth, O Lord, is full of thy mercy: teach me thy justifications. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="65">65 </span>Thou hast done well with thy servant, O Lord, according to thy word. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="66">66 </span>Teach me goodness and discipline and knowledge; for I have believed thy commandments. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="67">67 </span>Before I was humbled I offended; therefore have I kept thy word. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="68">68 </span>Thou art good; and in thy goodness teach me thy justifications. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="69">69 </span>The iniquity of the proud hath been multiplied over me: but I will seek thy commandments with my whole heart. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="70">70 </span>Their heart is curdled like milk: but I have meditated on thy law. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="71">71 </span>It is good for me that thou hast humbled me, that I may learn thy justifications. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="72">72 </span>The law of thy mouth is good to me, above thousands of gold and silver. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="73">73 </span>Thy hands have made me and formed me: give me understanding, and I will learn thy commandments. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="74">74 </span>They that fear thee shall see me, and shall be glad: because I have greatly hoped in thy words. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="75">75 </span>I know, O Lord, that thy judgments are equity: and in thy truth thou hast humbled me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="76">76 </span>O! let thy mercy be for my comfort, according to thy word unto thy servant. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="77">77 </span>Let thy tender mercies come unto me, and I shall live: for thy law is my meditation. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="78">78 </span>Let the proud be ashamed, because they have done unjustly towards me: but I will be employed in thy commandments. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="79">79 </span>Let them that fear thee turn to me" and they that know thy testimonies. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="80">80 </span>Let my heart be undefiled in thy justifications, that I may not be confounded. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="81">81 </span>My soul hath fainted after thy salvation: and in thy word I have very much hoped. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="82">82 </span>My eyes have failed for thy word, saying: When wilt thou comfort me? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="83">83 </span>For I am become like a bottle in the frost: I have not forgotten thy justifications. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="84">84 </span>How many are the days of thy servant: when wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="85">85 </span>The wicked have told me fables: but not as thy law. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="86">86 </span>All thy statutes are truth: they have persecuted me unjustly, do thou help me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="87">87 </span>They had almost made an end of me upon earth: but I have not forsaken thy commandments. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="88">88 </span>Quicken thou me according to thy mercy: and I shall keep the testimonies of thy mouth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="89">89 </span>For ever, O Lord, thy word standeth firm in heaven. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="90">90 </span>Thy truth unto all generations: thou hast founded the earth, and it continueth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="91">91 </span>By thy ordinance the day goeth on: for all things serve thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="92">92 </span>Unless thy law had been my meditation, I had then perhaps perished in my abjection. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="93">93 </span>Thy justifications I will never forget: for by them thou hast given me life. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="94">94 </span>I am thine, save thou me: for I have sought thy justifications. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="95">95 </span>The wicked have waited for me to destroy me: but I have understood thy testimonies. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="96">96 </span>I have seen an end to all persecution: thy commandment is exceeding broad. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="97">97 </span>O how have I loved thy law, O Lord! it is my meditation all the day. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="98">98 </span>Through thy commandment, thou hast made me wiser than my enemies: for it is ever with me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="99">99 </span>I have understood more than all my teachers: because thy testimonies are my meditation. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="100">100 </span>I have had understanding above ancients: because I have sought thy commandments.
