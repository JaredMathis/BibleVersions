<h3>Psalm 78 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver"> Understanding for Asaph. 
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>Attend, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>I will open my mouth in parables: I will utter propositions from the beginning. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>How great things have we heard and known, and our fathers have told us. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>They have not been hidden from their children, in another generation. Declaring the praises of the Lord, and his powers, and his wonders which he hath done. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>And he set up a testimony in Jacob: and made a law in Israel. How great things he commanded our fathers, that they should make the same known to their children: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>that another generation might know them. The children that should be born and should rise up, and declare them to their children. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>That they may put their hope in God and may not forget the works of God: and may seek his commandments. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>That they may not become like their fathers, a perverse end exasperating generation. A generation that set not their heart aright: and whose spirit was not faithful to God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>The sons of Ephraim who bend and shoot with the bow: they have turned back in the day of battle. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>They kept not the covenant of God: and in his law they would not walk. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And they forgot his benefits, and his wonders that he had shewn them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>Wonderful things did he do in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Tanis. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>He divided the sea and brought them through: and he made the waters to stand as in a vessel. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>And he conducted them with a cloud by day: and all the night with a light of 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>He struck the rock in the wilderness: and gave them to drink, as out of the great deep. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>He brought forth water out of the rock: and made streams run down as rivers. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And they added yet more sin against him: they provoked the most High to wrath in the place without water. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>And they tempted God in their hearts, by asking meat for their desires. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>And they spoke ill of God: they said: Can God furnish a table in the wilderness? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>Because he struck the rock, and the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed. Can he also give bread, or provide a table for his people? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>Therefore the Lord heard, and was angry: and a fire was kindled against Jacob, and wrath came up against Israel. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>Because they believed not in God: and trusted not in his salvation. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>And he had commanded the clouds from above, and had opened the doors of heaven. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them the bread of heaven. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>Man ate the bread of angels: he sent them provisions in abundance. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>He removed the south wind from heaven: and by his power brought in the southwest wind. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>And he rained upon them flesh as dust: and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>And they fell in the midst of their camp, round about their pavilions. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>So they did eat, and were filled exceedingly, and he gave them their desire: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>they were not defrauded of that which they craved. As yet their meat was in their mouth: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>and the wrath of God came upon them. And he slew the fat ones amongst them, and brought down the chosen men of Israel. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>In all these things they sinned still: and they believed not for his wondrous works. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>And their days were consumed in vanity, and their years in haste. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34 </span>When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned, and came to him early in the morning. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35 </span>And they remembered that God was their helper: and the most high God their redeemer. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36 </span>And they loved him with their mouth: and with their tongue they lied unto him: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37 </span>But their heart was not right with him: nor were they counted faithful in his covenant. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38 </span>But he is merciful, and will forgive their sins: and will not destroy them. And many a time did he turn away his anger: and did not kindle all his wrath. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39 </span>And he remembered that they are flesh: a wind that goeth and returneth not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40 </span>How often did they provoke him in the desert: and move him to wrath in the place without water? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41 </span>And they turned back and tempted God: and grieved the holy one of Israel. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42 </span>They remembered not his hand, in the day that he redeemed them from the hand of him that afflicted them: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="43">43 </span>How he wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Tanis. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="44">44 </span>And he turned their rivers into blood, and their showers that they might, not drink. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="45">45 </span>He sent amongst them divers sores of flies, which devoured them: and frogs which destroyed them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="46">46 </span>And he gave up their fruits to the blast, and their labours to the locust. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="47">47 </span>And he destroyed their vineyards with hail, and their mulberry trees with hoarfrost. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="48">48 </span>And he gave up their cattle to the hail, and their stock to the fire. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="49">49 </span>And he sent upon them the wrath of his indignation: indignation and wrath and trouble, which he sent by evil angels. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="50">50 </span>He made a way for a path to his anger: he spared not their souls from death, and their cattle he shut up in death. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="51">51 </span>And he killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt: the firstfruits of all their labour in the tabernacles of Cham. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="52">52 </span>And he took away his own people as sheep: and guided them in the wilderness like a flock. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="53">53 </span>And he brought them out in hope, and they feared not: band the sea overwhelmed their enemies. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="54">54 </span>And he brought them into the mountain of his sanctuary: the mountain which his right hand had purchased. And he cast out the Gentiles before them: and by lot divided to them their land by a line of distribution. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="55">55 </span>And he made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tabernacles. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="56">56 </span>Yet they tempted, and provoked the most high God: and they kept not his testimonies. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="57">57 </span>And they turned away, and kept not the covenant: even like their fathers they were turned aside as a crooked bow. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="58">58 </span>They provoked him to anger on their hills: and moved him to jealousy with their graven things. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="59">59 </span>God heard, and despised them, and he reduced Israel exceedingly as it were to nothing. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="60">60 </span>And he put away the tabernacle of Silo, his tabernacle where he dwelt among men. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="61">61 </span>And he delivered their strength into captivity: and their beauty into the hands of the enemy. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="62">62 </span>And he shut up his people under the sword: and he despised his inheritance. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="63">63 </span>Fire consumed their young men: and their maidens were not lamented. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="64">64 </span>Their priests fell by the sword: and their widows did not mourn. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="65">65 </span>And the Lord was awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that hath been surfeited with wine. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="66">66 </span>And he smote his enemies on the hinder parts: he put them to an everlasting reproach. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="67">67 </span>And he rejected the tabernacle of Joseph: and chose not the tribe of Ephraim: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="68">68 </span>But he chose the tribe of Juda, mount Sion which he loved. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="69">69 </span>And he built his sanctuary as of unicorns, in the land which he founded for ever. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="70">70 </span>And he chose his servant David, and took him from the hocks of sheep: he brought him from following the ewes great with young, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="71">71 </span>To feed Jacob his servant, and Israel his inheritance. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="72">72 </span>And he fed them in the innocence of his heart: and conducted them by the skilfulness of his hands. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
