<h3>Chapter 7 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>JUDGE not, that you may not be judged, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>For with what judgment you judge, you shall be judged: and with what measure you mete, it shall be measured to you again. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>Any why seest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye; and seest not the beam that is in thy own eye? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>Or how sayest thou to thy brother: Let me cast the mote out of thy eye; and behold a beam is in thy own eye? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam in thy own eye, and then shalt thou see to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>Give not that which is holy to dogs; neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest perhaps they trample them under their feet, and turning upon you, they tear you. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>Ask, and it shall be given you: seek, and you shall find: knock, and it shall be opened to you. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>For every one that asketh, receiveth: and he that seeketh, findeth: and to him that knocketh, it shall be opened. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>Or what man is there among you, of whom if his son shall ask bread, will he reach him a stone? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>Or if he shall ask him a fish, will he reach him a serpent? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>If you then being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children: how much more will your Father who is in heaven, give good things to them that ask him? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>All things therefore whatsoever you would that men should do to you, do you also to them. For this is the law and the prophets. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>Enter ye in at the narrow gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction, and many there are who go in thereat. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>How narrow is the gate, and strait is the way that leadeth to life: and few there are that find it! 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>Beware of false prophets, who come to you in the clothing of sheep, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>By their fruits you shall know them. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit, and the evil tree bringeth forth evil fruit. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can an evil tree bring forth good fruit. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit, shall be cut down, and shall be cast into the fire. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>Wherefore by their fruits you shall know them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>Not every one that saith to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven: but he that doth the will of my Father who is in heaven, he shall enter into the kingdom of heaven. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>Many will say to me in that day: Lord, Lord, have not we prophesied in thy name, and cast out devils in thy name, and done many miracles in thy name? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, you that work iniquity. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>Every one therefore that heareth these my words, and doth them, shall be likened to a wise man that built his house upon a rock, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and they beat upon that house, and it fell not, for it was founded on a rock. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>And every one that heareth these my words, and doth them not, shall be like a foolish man that built his house upon the sand, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and they beat upon that house, and it fell, and great was the fall thereof. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>And it came to pass when Jesus had fully ended these words, the people were in admiration at his doctrine. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>For he was teaching them as one having power, and not as the scribes and Pharisees. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
