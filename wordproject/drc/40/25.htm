<h3>Chapter 25 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>THEN shall the kingdom of heaven be like to ten virgins, who taking their lamps went out to meet the bridegroom and the bride. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And five of them were foolish, and five wise. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>But the five foolish, having taken their lamps, did not take oil with them: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>But the wise took oil in their vessels with the lamps. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>And the bridegroom tarrying, they all slumbered and slept. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>And at midnight there was a cry made: Behold the bridegroom cometh, go ye forth to meet him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And the foolish said to the wise: Give us of your oil, for our lamps are gone out. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>The wise answered, saying: Lest perhaps there be not enough for us and for you, go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>Now whilst they went to buy, the bridegroom came: and they that were ready, went in with him to the marriage, and the door was shut. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>But at last come also the other virgins, saying: Lord, Lord, open to us. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>But he answering said: Amen I say to you, I know you not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>Watch ye therefore, because you know not the day nor the hour. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>For even as a man going into a far country, called his servants, and delivered to them his goods; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And to one he gave five talents, and to another two, and to another one, to every one according to his proper ability: and immediately he took his journey. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>And he that had received the five talents, went his way, and traded with the same, and gained other five. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And in like manner he that had received the two, gained other two. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>But he that had received the one, going his way digged into the earth, and hid his lord's money. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>But after a long time the lord of those servants came, and reckoned with them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>And he that had received the five talents coming, brought other five talents, saying: Lord, thou didst deliver to me five talents, behold I have gained other five over and above. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>His lord said to him: Well done, good and faithful servant, because thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will place thee over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>And he also that had received the two talents came and said: Lord, thou deliveredst two talents to me: behold I have gained other two. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>His lord said to him: Well done, good and faithful servant: because thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will place thee over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>But he that had received the one talent, came and said: Lord, I know that thou art a hard man; thou reapest where thou hast not sown, and gatherest where thou hast not strewed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>And being afraid I went and hid thy talent in the earth: behold here thou hast that which is thine. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>And his lord answering, said to him: Wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sow not, and gather where I have not strewed: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>Thou oughtest therefore to have committed my money to the bankers, and at my coming I should have received my own with usury. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>Take ye away therefore the talent from him, and give it to him that hath ten talents. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>For to every one that hath shall be given, and he shall abound: but from him that hath not, that also which he seemeth to have shall be taken away. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>And the unprofitable servant cast ye out into the exterior darkness. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>And when the Son of man shall come in his majesty, and all the angels with him, then shall he sit upon the seat of his majesty. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>And all nations shall be gathered together before him, and he shall separate them one from another, as the shepherd separateth the sheep from the goats: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on his left. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34 </span>Then shall the king say to them that shall be on his right hand: Come, ye blessed of my Father, possess you the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35 </span>For I was hungry, and you gave me to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave me to drink; I was a stranger, and you took me in: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36 </span>Naked, and you covered me: sick, and you visited me: I was in prison, and you came to me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37 </span>Then shall the just answer him, saying: Lord, when did we see thee hungry, and fed thee; thirsty, and gave thee drink? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38 </span>And when did we see thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and covered thee? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39 </span>Or when did we see thee sick or in prison, and came to thee? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40 </span>And the king answering, shall say to them: Amen I say to you, as long as you did it to one of these my least brethren, you did it to me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41 </span>Then he shall say to them also that shall be on his left hand: Depart from me, you cursed, into everlasting fire which was prepared for the devil and his angels. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42 </span>For I was hungry, and you gave me not to eat: I was thirsty, and you gave me not to drink. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="43">43 </span>I was a stranger, and you took me not in: naked, and you covered me not: sick and in prison, and you did not visit me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="44">44 </span>Then they also shall answer him, saying: Lord, when did we see thee hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister to thee? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="45">45 </span>Then he shall answer them, saying: Amen I say to you, as long as you did it not to one of these least, neither did you do it to me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="46">46 </span>And these shall go into everlasting punishment: but the just, into life everlasting. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
