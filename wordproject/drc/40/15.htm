<h3>Chapter 15 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>THEN came to him from Jerusalem scribes and Pharisees, saying: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>Why do thy disciples trangress the tradition of the ancients? For they wash not their hands when they eat bread. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>But he answering, said to them: Why do you also transgress the commandment of God for your tradition? For God said: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>Honour thy father and mother: And: He that shall curse father or mother, let him die the death. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>But you say: Whosoever shall say to father or mother, The gift whatsoever proceedeth from me, shall profit thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>And he shall not honour his father or his mother: and you have made void the commandment of God for your tradition. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>Hypocrites, well hath Isaias prophesied of you, saying: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>This people honoureth me with their lips: but their heart is far from me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>And in vain do they worship me, teaching doctrines and commandments of men. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>And having called together the multitudes unto him, he said to them: Hear ye and understand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man: but what cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>Then came his disciples, and said to him: Dost thou know that the Pharisees, when they heard this word, were scandalized? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>But he answering them, said: Every plant which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>Let them alone: they are blind, and leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both will fall into the pit. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And Peter answering, said to him: Expound to us this parable. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>But he said: Are you also yet without understanding? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>Do you not understand, that whatsoever entereth into the mouth, goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the privy? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>But the things which proceed out of the mouth, come forth from the heart, and those things defile a man. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>For from the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false testimonies, blasphemies. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>These are the things that defile a man. But to eat with unwashed hands doth not defile a man. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>And Jesus went from thence, and retired into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>And behold a woman of Canaan who came out of those coasts, crying out, said to him: Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David: my daughter is grieviously troubled by the devil. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>Who answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying: Send her away, for she crieth after us: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>And he answering, said: I was not sent but to the sheep that are lost of the house of Israel. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>But she came and adored him, saying: Lord, help me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>Who answering, said: It is not good to take the bread of the children, and to cast it to the dogs. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>But she said: Yea, Lord; for the whelps also eat of the crumbs that fall from the table of their masters. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>Then Jesus answering, said to her: O woman, great is thy faith: be it done to thee as thou wilt: and her daughter was cured from that hour. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>And when Jesus had passed away from thence, he came nigh the sea of Galilee. And going up into a mountain, he sat there. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>And there came to him great multitudes, having with them the dumb, the blind, the lame, the maimed, and many others: and they cast them down at his feet, and he healed them: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>So that the multitudes marvelled seeing the dumb speak, the lame walk, and the blind see: and they glorified the God of Israel. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>And Jesus called together his disciples, and said: I have compassion on the multitudes, because they continue with me now three days, and have not what to eat, and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>And the disciples say unto him: Whence then should we have so many loaves in the desert, as to fill so great a multitude? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34 </span>And Jesus said to them: How many loaves have you? But they said: Seven, and a few little fishes. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35 </span>And he commanded the multitude to sit down upon the ground. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36 </span>And taking the seven loaves and the fishes, and giving thanks, he brake, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the people. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37 </span>And they did all eat, and had their fill. And they took up seven baskets full, of what remained of the fragments. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38 </span>And they that did eat, were four thousand men, beside children and women. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39 </span>And having dismissed the multitude, he went up into a boat, and came into the coasts of Magedan. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
