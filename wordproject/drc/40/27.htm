<h3>Chapter 27 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>AND when morning was come, all the chief priests and ancients of the people took counsel against Jesus, that they might put him to death. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And they brought him bound, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>Then Judas, who betrayed him, seeing that he was condemned, repenting himself, brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and ancients, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>Saying: I have sinned in betraying innocent blood. But they said: What is that to us? look thou to it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>And casting down the pieces of silver in the temple, he departed: and went and hanged himself with an halter. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>But the chief priests having taken the pieces of silver, said: It is not lawful to put them into the corbona, because it is the price of blood. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>And after they had consulted together, they bought with them the potter's field, to be a burying place for strangers. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>For this cause the field was called Haceldama, that is, The field of blood, even to this day. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremias the prophet, saying: And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was prized, whom they prized of the children of Israel. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>And they gave them unto the potter's field, as the Lord appointed to me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, saying: Art thou the king of the Jews? Jesus saith to him: Thou sayest it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And when he was accused by the chief priests and ancients, he answered nothing. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>Then Pilate saith to him: Dost not thou hear how great testimonies they allege against thee? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>And he answered him to never a word; so that the governor wondered exceedingly. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>Now upon the solemn day the governor was accustomed to release to the people one prisoner, whom they would. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>And he had then a notorious prisoner, that was called Barabbas. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>They therefore being gathered together, Pilate said: Whom will you that I release to you, Barabbas, or Jesus that is called Christ? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>For he knew that for envy they had delivered him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>And as he was sitting in the place of judgment, his wife sent to him, saying: Have thou nothing to do with that just man; for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>But the chief priests and ancients persuaded the people, that they should ask Barabbas, and make Jesus away. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>And the governor answering, said to them: Whether will you of the two to be released unto you? But they said, Barabbas. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>Pilate saith to them: What shall I do then with Jesus that is called Christ? They say all: Let him be crucified. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>The governor said to them: Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying: Let him be crucified. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>And Pilate seeing that he prevailed nothing, but that rather a tumult was made; taking water washed his hands before the people, saying: I am innocent of the blood of this just man; look you to it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>And the whole people answering, said: His blood be upon us and our children. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>Then he released to them Barabbas, and having scourged Jesus, delivered him unto them to be crucified. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>Then the soldiers of the governor taking Jesus into the hall, gathered together unto him the whole band; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>And stripping him, they put a scarlet cloak about him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>And platting a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand. And bowing the knee before him, they mocked him, saying: Hail, king of the Jews. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>And spitting upon him, they took the reed, and struck his head. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>And after they had mocked him, they took off the cloak from him, and put on him his own garments, and led him away to crucify him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>And going out, they found a man of Cyrene, named Simon: him they forced to take up his cross. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>And they came to the place that is called Golgotha, which is the place of Calvary. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34 </span>And they gave him wine to drink mingled with gall. And when he had tasted, he would not drink. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35 </span>And after they had crucified him, they divided his garments, casting lots; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying: They divided my garments among them; and upon my vesture they cast lots. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36 </span>And they sat and watched him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37 </span>And they put over his head his cause written: THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38 </span>Then were crucified with him two thieves: one on the right hand, and one on the left. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39 </span>And they that passed by, blasphemed him, wagging their heads, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40 </span>And saying: Vah, thou that destroyest the temple of God, and in three days dost rebuild it: save thy own self: if thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41 </span>In like manner also the chief priests, with the scribes and ancients, mocking, said: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42 </span>He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the king of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="43">43 </span>He trusted in God; let him now deliver him if he will have him; for he said: I am the Son of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="44">44 </span>And the selfsame thing the thieves also, that were crucified with him, reproached him with. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="45">45 </span>Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over the whole earth, until the ninth hour. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="46">46 </span>And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying: Eli, Eli, lamma sabacthani? that is, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="47">47 </span>And some that stood there and heard, said: This man calleth Elias. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="48">48 </span>And immediately one of them running took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar; and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="49">49 </span>And the others said: Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to deliver him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="50">50 </span>And Jesus again crying with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="51">51 </span>And behold the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top even to the bottom, and the earth quaked, and the rocks were rent. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="52">52 </span>And the graves were opened: and many bodies of the saints that had slept arose, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="53">53 </span>And coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, came into the holy city, and appeared to many. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="54">54 </span>Now the centurion and they that were with him watching Jesus, having seen the earthquake, and the things that were done, were sore afraid, saying: Indeed this was the Son of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="55">55 </span>And there were there many women afar off, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="56">56 </span>Among whom was Mary Magdalen, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="57">57 </span>And when it was evening, there came a certain rich man of Arimathea, named Joseph, who also himself was a disciple of Jesus. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="58">58 </span>He went to Pilate, and asked the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded that the body should be delivered. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="59">59 </span>And Joseph taking the body, wrapped it up in a clean linen cloth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="60">60 </span>And laid it in his own new monument, which he had hewed out in a rock. And he rolled a great stone to the door of the monument, and went his way. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="61">61 </span>And there was there Mary Magdalen, and the other Mary sitting over against the sepulchre. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="62">62 </span>And the next day, which followed the day of preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees came together to Pilate, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="63">63 </span>Saying: Sir, we have remembered, that that seducer said, while he was yet alive: After three days I will rise again. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="64">64 </span>Command therefore the sepulchre to be guarded until the third day: lest perhaps his disciples come and steal him away, and say to the people: He is risen from the dead; and the last error shall be worse than the first. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="65">65 </span>Pilate saith to them: You have a guard; go, guard it as you know. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="66">66 </span>And they departing, made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting guards. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
