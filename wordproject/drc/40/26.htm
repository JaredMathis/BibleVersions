<h3>Chapter 26 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>AND it came to pass, when Jesus had ended all these words, he said to his disciples: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>You know that after two days shall be the pasch, and the son of man shall be delivered up to be crucified: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>Then were gathered together the chief priests and ancients of the people into the court of the high priest, who was called Caiphas: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And they consulted together, that by subtilty they might apprehend Jesus, and put him to death. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>But they said: Not on the festival day, lest perhaps there should be a tumult among the people. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>And when Jesus was in Bethania, in the house of Simon the leper, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>There came to him a woman having an alabaster box of precious ointment, and poured it on his head as he was at table. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And the disciples seeing it, had indignation, saying: To what purpose is this waste? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>For this might have been sold for much, and given to the poor. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>And Jesus knowing it, said to them: Why do you trouble this woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>For the poor you have always with you: but me you have not always. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>For she in pouring this ointment upon my body, hath done it for my burial. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>Amen I say to you, wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, that also which she hath done, shall be told for a memory of her. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>Then went one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, to the chief priests, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And said to them: What will you give me, and I will deliver him unto you? But they appointed him thirty pieces of silver. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>And from thenceforth he sought opportunity to betray him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And on the first day of the Azymes, the disciples came to Jesus, saying: Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the pasch? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>But Jesus said: Go ye into the city to a certain man, and say to him: the master saith, My time is near at hand, with thee I make the pasch with my disciples. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>And the disciples did as Jesus appointed to them, and they prepared the pasch. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>But when it was evening, he sat down with his twelve disciples. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>And whilst they were eating, he said: Amen I say to you, that one of you is about to betray me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>And they being very much troubled, began every one to say: Is it I, Lord? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>But he answering, said: He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, he shall betray me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man shall be betrayed: it were better for him, if that man had not been born. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>And Judas that betrayed him, answering, said: Is it I, Rabbi? He saith to him: Thou hast said it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>And whilst they were at supper, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and broke: and gave to his disciples, and said: Take ye, and eat. This is my body. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>And taking the chalice, he gave thanks, and gave to them, saying: Drink ye all of this. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>For this is my blood of the new testament, which shall be shed for many unto remission of sins. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>And I say to you, I will not drink from henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I shall drink it with you new in the kingdom of my Father. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>And a hymn being said, they went out unto mount Olivet. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>Then Jesus said to them: All you shall be scandalized in me this night. For it is written: I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be dispersed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>But after I shall be risen again, I will go before you into Galilee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>And Peter answering, said to him: Although all shall be scandalized in thee, I will never be scandalized. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34 </span>Jesus said to him: Amen I say to thee, that in this night before the cock crow, thou wilt deny me thrice. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35 </span>Peter saith to him: Yea, though I should die with thee, I will not deny thee. And in like manner said all the disciples. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36 </span>Then Jesus came with them into a country place which is called Gethsemani; and he said to his disciples: Sit you here, till I go yonder and pray. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37 </span>And taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to grow sorrowful and to be sad. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38 </span>Then he saith to them: My soul is sorrowful even unto death: stay you here, and watch with me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39 </span>And going a little further, he fell upon his face, praying, and saying: My Father, if it be possible, let this chalice pass from me. Nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40 </span>And he cometh to his disciples, and findeth them asleep, and he saith to Peter: What? Could you not watch one hour with me? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41 </span>Watch ye, and pray that ye enter not into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh weak. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42 </span>Again the second time, he went and prayed, saying: My Father, if this chalice may not pass away, but I must drink it, thy will be done. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="43">43 </span>And he cometh again and findeth them sleeping: for their eyes were heavy. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="44">44 </span>And leaving them, he went again: and he prayed the third time, saying the selfsame word. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="45">45 </span>Then he cometh to his disciples, and saith to them: Sleep ye now and take your rest; behold the hour is at hand, and the Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of sinners. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="46">46 </span>Rise, let us go: behold he is at hand that will betray me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="47">47 </span>As he yet spoke, behold Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and the ancients of the people. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="48">48 </span>And he that betrayed him, gave them a sign, saying: Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he, hold him fast. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="49">49 </span>And forthwith coming to Jesus, he said: Hail, Rabbi. And he kissed him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="50">50 </span>And Jesus said to him: Friend, whereto art thou come? Then they came up, and laid hands on Jesus, and held him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="51">51 </span>And behold one of them that were with Jesus, stretching forth his hand, drew out his sword: and striking the servant of the high priest, cut off his ear. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="52">52 </span>Then Jesus saith to him: Put up again thy sword into its place: for all that take the sword shall perish with the sword. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="53">53 </span>Thinkest thou that I cannot ask my Father, and he will give me presently more than twelve legions of angels? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="54">54 </span>How then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that so it must be done? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="55">55 </span>In that same hour Jesus said to the multitudes: You are come out as it were to a robber with swords and clubs to apprehend me. I sat daily with you, teaching in the temple, and you laid not hands on me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="56">56 </span>Now all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then the disciples all leaving him, fled. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="57">57 </span>But they holding Jesus led him to Caiphas the high priest, where the scribes and the ancients were assembled. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="58">58 </span>And Peter followed him afar off, even to the court of the high priest. And going in, he sat with the servants, that he might see the end. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="59">59 </span>And the chief priests and the whole council sought false witness against Jesus, that they might put him to death: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="60">60 </span>And they found not, whereas many false witnesses had come in. And last of all there came two false witnesses: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="61">61 </span>And they said: This man said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and after three days to rebuild it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="62">62 </span>And the high priest rising up, said to him: Answerest thou nothing to the things which these witness against thee? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="63">63 </span>But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest said to him: I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us if thou be the Christ the Son of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="64">64 </span>Jesus saith to him: Thou hast said it. Nevertheless I say to you, hereafter you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of the power of God, and coming in the clouds of heaven. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="65">65 </span>Then the high priests rent his garments, saying: He hath blasphemed; what further need have we of witnesses? Behold, now you have heard the blasphemy: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="66">66 </span>What think you? But they answering, said: He is guilty of death. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="67">67 </span>Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him: and others struck his face with the palms of their hands, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="68">68 </span>Saying: Prophesy unto us, O Christ, who is he that struck thee? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="69">69 </span>But Peter sat without in the court: and there came to him a servant maid, saying: Thou also wast with Jesus the Galilean. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="70">70 </span>But he denied before them all, saying: I know not what thou sayest. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="71">71 </span>And as he went out of the gate, another maid saw him, and she saith to them that were there: This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="72">72 </span>And again he denied with an oath, I know not the man. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="73">73 </span>And after a little while they came that stood by, and said to Peter: Surely thou also art one of them; for even thy speech doth discover thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="74">74 </span>Then he began to curse and to swear that he knew not the man. And immediately the cock crew. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="75">75 </span>And Peter remembered the word of Jesus which he had said: Before the cock crow, thou wilt deny me thrice. And going forth, he wept bitterly. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
