<h3>Chapter 22 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>AND Jesus answering, spoke again in parables to them, saying: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>The kingdom of heaven is likened to a king, who made a marriage for his son. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>And he sent his servants, to call them that were invited to the marriage; and they would not come. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>Again he sent other servants, saying: Tell them that were invited, Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my beeves and fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come ye to the marriage. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>But they neglected, and went their own ways, one to his farm, and another to his merchandise. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>And the rest laid hands on his servants, and having treated them contumeliously, put them to death. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>But when the king had heard of it, he was angry, and sending his armies, he destroyed those murderers, and burnt their city. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>Then he saith to his servants: The marriage indeed is ready; but they that were invited were not worthy. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>Go ye therefore into the highways; and as many as you shall find, call to the marriage. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>And his servants going forth into the ways, gathered together all that they found, both bad and good: and the marriage was filled with guests. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And the king went in to see the guests: and he saw there a man who had not on a wedding garment. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And he saith to him: Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? But he was silent. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>Then the king said to the waiters: Bind his hands and feet, and cast him into the exterior darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>For many are called, but few are chosen. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>Then the Pharisees going, consulted among themselves how to insnare him in his speech. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>And they sent to him their disciples with the Herodians, saying: Master, we know that thou art a true speaker, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou dost not regard the person of men. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>Tell us therefore what dost thou think, is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>But Jesus knowing their wickedness, said: Why do you tempt me, ye hypocrites? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>Shew me the coin of the tribute. And they offered him a penny. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>And Jesus saith to them: Whose image and inscription is this? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>They say to him: Caesar's. Then he saith to them: Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's; and to God, the things that are God's. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>And hearing this they wondered, and leaving him, went their ways. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>That day there came to him the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection; and asked him, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>Saying: Master, Moses said: If a man die having no son, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up issue to his brother. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first having married a wife, died; and not having issue, left his wife to his brother. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>In like manner the second, and the third, and so on to the seventh. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>And last of all the woman died also. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>At the resurrection therefore whose wife of the seven shall she be? for they all had her. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>And Jesus answering, said to them: You err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>For in the resurrection they shall neither marry nor be married; but shall be as the angels of God in heaven. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>And concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read that which was spoken by God, saying to you: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>And the multitudes hearing it, were in admiration at his doctrine. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34 </span>But the Pharisees hearing that he had silenced the Sadducees, came together: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35 </span>And one of them, a doctor of the law, asking him, tempting him: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36 </span>Master, which is the greatest commandment in the law? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37 </span>Jesus said to him: Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart, and with thy whole soul, and with thy whole mind. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38 </span>This is the greatest and the first commandment. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39 </span>And the second is like to this: Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40 </span>On these two commandments dependeth the whole law and the prophets. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41 </span>And the Pharisees being gathered together, Jesus asked them, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42 </span>Saying: What think you of Christ? whose son is he? They say to him: David's. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="43">43 </span>He saith to them: How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="44">44 </span>The Lord said to my Lord, Sit on my right hand, until I make thy enemies thy footstool? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="45">45 </span>If David then call him Lord, how is he his son? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="46">46 </span>And no man was able to answer him a word; neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
