<h3>Chapter 4 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>WHAT shall we say then that Abraham hath found, who is our father according to the flesh. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory, but not before God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was reputed to him unto justice. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>Now to him that worketh, the reward is not reckoned according to grace, but according to debt. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>But to him that worketh not, yet believeth in him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is reputed to justice, according to the purpose of the grace of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>As David also termeth the blessedness of a man, to whom God reputeth justice without works: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>Blessed is the man to whom the Lord hath not imputed sin. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>This blessedness then, doth it remain in the circumcision only, or in the uncircumcision also? For we say that unto Abraham faith was reputed to justice. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>How then was it reputed? When he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the justice of the faith, which he had, being uncircumcised; that he might be the father of all them that believe, being uncircumcised, that unto them also it may be reputed to justice: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And might be the father of circumcision; not to them only, that are of the circumcision, but to them also that follow the steps of the faithful, that is in the uncircumcision of our father Abraham. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>For not through the law was the promise to Abraham, or to his seed, that he should be heir of the world; but through the justice of faith. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>For if they who are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, the promise is made of no effect. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>For the law worketh wrath. For where there is no law, neither is there transgression. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>Therefore is it of faith, that according to grace the promise might be firm to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>(As it is written: I have made thee a father of many nations,) before God, whom he believed, who quickeneth the dead; and calleth those things that are not, as those that are. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>Who against hope believed in hope; that he might be made the father of many nations, according to that which was said to him: So shall thy seed be. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>And he was not weak in faith; neither did he consider his own body now dead, whereas he was almost an hundred years old, nor the dead womb of Sara. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>In the promise also of God he staggered not by distrust; but was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>Most fully knowing, that whatsoever he has promised, he is able also to perform. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>And therefore it was reputed to him unto justice. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>Now it is not written only for him, that it was reputed to him unto justice, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>But also for us, to whom it shall be reputed, if we believe in him, that raised up Jesus Christ, our Lord, from the dead, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>Who was delivered up for our sins, and rose again for our justification. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
