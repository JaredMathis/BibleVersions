<h3>Chapter 8 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>THERE is now therefore no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus, who walk not according to the flesh. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>For the law of the spirit of life, in Christ Jesus, hath delivered me from the law of sin and of death. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh; God sending his own Son, in the likeness of sinful flesh and of sin, hath condemned sin in the flesh; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>That the justification of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh, but according to the spirit. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>For they that are according to the flesh, mind the things that are of the flesh; but they that are according to the spirit, mind the things that are of the spirit. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>For the wisdom of the flesh is death; but the wisdom of the spirit is life and peace. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>Because the wisdom of the flesh is an enemy to God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither can it be. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And they who are in the flesh, cannot please God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>And if Christ be in you, the body indeed is dead, because of sin; but the spirit liveth, because of justification. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead, dwell in you; he that raised up Jesus Christ from the dead, shall quicken also your mortal bodies, because of his Spirit that dwelleth in you. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>For if you live according to the flesh, you shall die: but if by the Spirit you mortify the deeds of the flesh, you shall live. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>For whosoever are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>For you have not received the spirit of bondage again in fear; but you have received the spirit of adoption of sons, whereby we cry: Abba (Father). 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>For the Spirit himself giveth testimony to our spirit, that we are the sons of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And if sons, heirs also; heirs indeed of God, and joint heirs with Christ: yet so, if we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified with him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>For I reckon that the sufferings of this time are not worthy to be compared with the glory to come, that shall be revealed in us. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>For the expectation of the creature waiteth for the revelation of the sons of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him that made it subject, in hope: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>Because the creature also itself shall be delivered from the servitude of corruption, into the liberty of the glory of the children of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>For we know that every creature groaneth and travaileth in pain, even till now. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>And not only it, but ourselves also, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption of the sons of God, the redemption of our body. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>For we are saved by hope. But hope that is seen, is not hope. For what a man seeth, why doth he hope for? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>But if we hope for that which we see not, we wait for it with patience. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmity. For we know not what we should pray for as we ought; but the Spirit himself asketh for us with unspeakable groanings. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>And he that searcheth the hearts, knoweth what the Spirit desireth; because he asketh for the saints according to God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>And we know that to them that love God, all things work together unto good, to such as, according to his purpose, are called to be saints. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>For whom he foreknew, he also predestinated to be made conformable to the image of his Son; that he might be the firstborn amongst many brethren. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>And whom he predestinated, them he also called. And whom he called, them he also justified. And whom he justified, them he also glorified. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who is against us? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>He that spared not even his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how hath he not also, with him, given us all things? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>Who shall accuse against the elect of God? God that justifieth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34 </span>Who is he that shall condemn? Christ Jesus that died, yea that is risen also again; who is at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35 </span>Who then shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation? or distress? or famine? or nakedness? or danger? or persecution? or the sword? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36 </span>(As it is written: For thy sake we are put to death all the day long. We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.) 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37 </span>But in all these things we overcome, because of him that hath loved us. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38 </span>For I am sure that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor might, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39 </span>Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
