<h3>Chapter 15 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>NOW we that are stronger, ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>Let every one of you please his neighbour unto good, to edification. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>For Christ did not please himself, but as it is written: The reproaches of them that reproached thee, fell upon me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>For what things soever were written, were written for our learning: that through patience and the comfort of the scriptures, we might have hope. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>Now the God of patience and of comfort grant you to be of one mind one towards another, according to Jesus Christ: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>That with one mind, and with one mouth, you may glorify God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>Wherefore receive one another, as Christ also hath received you unto the honour of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>For I say that Christ Jesus was minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>But that the Gentiles are to glorify God for his mercy, as it is written: Therefore will I confess to thee, O Lord, among the Gentiles, and will sing to thy name. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>And again he saith: Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And again: Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and magnify him, all ye people. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And again Isaias saith: There shall be a root of Jesse; and he that shall rise up to rule the Gentiles, in him the Gentiles shall hope. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing; that you may abound in hope, and in the power of the Holy Ghost. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>And I myself also, my brethren, am assured of you, that you also are full of love, replenished with all knowledge, so that you are able to admonish one another. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>But I have written to you, brethren, more boldly in some sort, as it were putting you in mind: because of the grace which is given me from God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>That I should be the minister of Christ Jesus among the Gentiles; sanctifying the gospel of God, that the oblation of the Gentiles may be made acceptable and sanctified in the Holy Ghost. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>I have therefore glory in Christ Jesus towards God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>For I dare not to speak of any of those things which Christ worketh not by me, for the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and deed, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>By the virtue of signs and wonders, in the power of the Holy Ghost, so that from Jerusalem round about as far as unto Illyricum, I have replenished the gospel of Christ. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>And I have so preached this gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man's foundation. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>But as it is written: They to whom he was not spoken of, shall see, and they that have not heard shall understand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>For which cause also I was hindered very much from coming to you, and have been kept away till now. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>But now having no more place in these countries, and having a great desire these many years past to come unto you, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>When I shall begin to take my journey into Spain, I hope that as I pass, I shall see you, and be brought on my way thither by you, if first, in part, I shall have enjoyed you: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>But now I shall go to Jerusalem, to minister unto the saints. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a contribution for the poor of the saints that are in Jerusalem. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>For it hath pleased them; and they are their debtors. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, they ought also in carnal things to minister to them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>When therefore I shall have accomplished this, and consigned to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>And I know, that when I come to you, I shall come in the abundance of the blessing of the gospel of Christ. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>I beseech you therefore, brethren, through our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the charity of the Holy Ghost, that you help me in your prayers for me to God, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>That I may be delivered from the unbelievers that are in Judea, and that the oblation of my service may be acceptable in Jerusalem to the saints. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>That I may come to you with joy, by the will of God, and may be refreshed with you. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
