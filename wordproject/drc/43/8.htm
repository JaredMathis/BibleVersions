<h3>Chapter 8 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>AND Jesus went unto mount Olivet. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came to him, and sitting down he taught them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>And the scribes and the Pharisees bring unto him a woman taken in adultery: and they set her in the midst, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And said to him: Master, this woman was even now taken in adultery. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>Now Moses in the law commanded us to stone such a one. But what sayest thou? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>And this they said tempting him, that they might accuse him. But Jesus bowing himself down, wrote with his finger on the ground. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>When therefore they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said to them: He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And again stooping down, he wrote on the ground. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>But they hearing this, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest. And Jesus alone remained, and the woman standing in the midst. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>Then Jesus lifting up himself, said to her: Woman, where are they that accused thee? Hath no man condemned thee? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>Who said: No man, Lord. And Jesus said: Neither will I condemn thee. Go, and now sin no more. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>Again therefore, Jesus spoke to them, saying: I am the light of the world: he that followeth me, walketh not in darkness, but shall have the light of life. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>The Pharisees therefore said to him: Thou givest testimony of thyself: thy testimony is not true. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>Jesus answered, and said to them: Although I give testimony of myself, my testimony is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go: but you know not whence I come, or whither I go. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>You judge according to the flesh: I judge not any man. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>And if I do judge, my judgment is true: because I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And in your law it is written, that the testimony of two men is true. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>I am one that give testimony of myself: and the Father that sent me giveth testimony of me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>They said therefore to him: Where is thy Father? Jesus answered: Neither me do you know, nor my Father: if you did know me, perhaps you would know my Father also. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>These words Jesus spoke in the treasury, teaching in the temple: and no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>Again therefore Jesus said to them: I go, and you shall seek me, and you shall die in your sin. Whither I go, you cannot come. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>The Jews therefore said: Will he kill himself, because he said: Whither I go, you cannot come? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>And he said to them: You are from beneath, I am from above. You are of this world, I am not of this world. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>Therefore I said to you, that you shall die in your sins. For if you believe not that I am he, you shall die in your sin. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>They said therefore to him: Who art thou? Jesus said to them: The beginning, who also speak unto you. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>Many things I have to speak and to judge of you. But he that sent me, is true: and the things I have heard of him, these same I speak in the world. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>And they understood not, that he called God his Father. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>Jesus therefore said to them: When you shall have lifted up the Son of man, then shall you know, that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself, but as the Father hath taught me, these things I speak: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>And he that sent me, is with me, and he hath not left me alone: for I do always the things that please him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>When he spoke these things, many believed in him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>Then Jesus said to those Jews, who believed him: If you continue in my word, you shall be my disciples indeed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>They answered him: We are the seed of Abraham, and we have never been slaves to any man: how sayest thou: you shall be free? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34 </span>Jesus answered them: Amen, amen I say unto you: that whosoever committeth sin, is the servant of sin. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35 </span>Now the servant abideth not in the house for ever; but the son abideth for ever. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36 </span>If therefore the son shall make you free, you shall be free indeed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37 </span>I know that you are the children of Abraham: but you seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38 </span>I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and you do the things that you have seen with your father. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39 </span>They answered, and said to him: Abraham is our father. Jesus saith to them: If you be the children of Abraham, do the works of Abraham. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40 </span>But now you seek to kill me, a man who have spoken the truth to you, which I have heard of God. This Abraham did not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41 </span>You do the works of your father. They said therefore to him: We are not born of fornication: we have one Father, even God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42 </span>Jesus therefore said to them: If God were your Father, you would indeed love me. For from God I proceeded, and came; for I came not of myself, but he sent me: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="43">43 </span>Why do you not know my speech? Because you cannot hear my word. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="44">44 </span>You are of your father the devil, and the desires of your father you will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and he stood not in the truth; because truth is not in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father thereof. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="45">45 </span>But if I say the truth, you believe me not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="46">46 </span>Which of you shall convince me of sin? If I say the truth to you, why do you not believe me? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="47">47 </span>He that is of God, heareth the words of God. Therefore you hear them not, because you are not of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="48">48 </span>The Jews therefore answered, and said to him: Do not we say well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="49">49 </span>Jesus answered: I have not a devil: but I honour my Father, and you have dishonoured me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="50">50 </span>But I seek not my own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="51">51 </span>Amen, amen I say to you: If any man keep my word, he shall not see death for ever. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="52">52 </span>The Jews therefore said: Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest: If any man keep my word, he shall not taste death for ever. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="53">53 </span>Art thou greater than our father Abraham, who is dead? and the prophets are dead. Whom dost thou make thyself? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="54">54 </span>Jesus answered: If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father that glorifieth me, of whom you say that he is your God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="55">55 </span>And you have not known him, but I know him. And if I shall say that I know him not, I shall be like to you, a liar. But I do know him, and do keep his word. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="56">56 </span>Abraham your father rejoiced that he might see my day: he saw it, and was glad. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="57">57 </span>The Jews therefore said to him: Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="58">58 </span>Jesus said to them: Amen, amen I say to you, before Abraham was made, I am. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="59">59 </span>They took up stones therefore to cast at him. But Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
