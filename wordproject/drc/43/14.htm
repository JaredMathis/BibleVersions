<h3>Chapter 14 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>LET not your heart be troubled. You believe in God, believe also in me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>In my Father's house there are many mansions. If not, I would have told you: because I go to prepare a place for you. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>And if I shall go, and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and will take you to myself; that where I am, you also may be. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And whither I go you know, and the way you know. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>Thomas saith to him: Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>Jesus saith to him: I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No man cometh to the Father, but by me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>If you had known me, you would without doubt have known my Father also: and from henceforth you shall know him, and you have seen him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>Philip saith to him: Lord, shew us the Father, and it is enough for us. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>Jesus saith to him: Have I been so long a time with you; and have you not known me? Philip, he that seeth me seeth the Father also. How sayest thou, Shew us the Father? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>Do you not believe, that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? The words that I speak to you, I speak not of myself. But the Father who abideth in me, he doth the works. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>Believe you not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>Otherwise believe for the very works' sake. Amen, amen I say to you, he that believeth in me, the works that I do, he also shall do; and greater than these shall he do. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>Because I go to the Father: and whatsoever you shall ask the Father in my name, that will I do: that the Father may be glorified in the Son. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>If you shall ask me any thing in my name, that I will do. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>If you love me, keep my commandments. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>And I will ask the Father, and he shall give you another Paraclete, that he may abide with you for ever. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>The spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, nor knoweth him: but you shall know him; because he shall abide with you, and shall be in you. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>I will not leave you orphans, I will come to you. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>Yet a little while: and the world seeth me no more. But you see me: because I live, and you shall live. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>In that day you shall know, that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them; he it is that loveth me. And he that loveth me, shall be loved of my Father: and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>Judas saith to him, not the Iscariot: Lord, how is it, that thou wilt manifest thyself to us, and not to the world? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>Jesus answered, and said to him: If any one love me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and will make our abode with him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>He that loveth me not, keepeth not my words. And the word which you have heard, is not mine; but the Father's who sent me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>These things have I spoken to you, abiding with you. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>But the Paraclete, the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things, and bring all things to your mind, whatsoever I shall have said to you. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, do I give unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, nor let it be afraid. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>You have heard that I said to you: I go away, and I come unto you. If you loved me, you would indeed be glad, because I go to the Father: for the Father is greater than I. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>And now I have told you before it comes to pass: that when it shall come to pass, you may believe. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>I will not now speak many things with you. For the prince of this world cometh, and in me he hath not any thing. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>But that the world may know, that I love the Father: and as the Father hath given me commandment, so do I: Arise, let us go hence. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
