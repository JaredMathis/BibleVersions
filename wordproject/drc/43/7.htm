<h3>Chapter 7 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>AFTER these things Jesus walked in Galilee; for he would not walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>Now the Jews' feast of tabernacles was at hand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>And his brethren said to him: Pass from hence, and go into Judea; that thy disciples also may see thy works which thou dost. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>For there is no man that doth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, manifest thyself to the world. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>For neither did his brethren believe in him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>Then Jesus said to them: My time is not yet come; but your time is always ready. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth: because I give testimony of it, that the works thereof are evil. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>Go you up to this festival day, but I go not up to this festival day: because my time is not accomplished. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>When he had said these things, he himself stayed in Galilee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>But after his brethren were gone up, then he also went up to the feast, not openly, but, as it were, in secret. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>The Jews therefore sought him on the festival day, and said: Where is he? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And there was much murmuring among the multitude concerning him. For some said: He is a good man. And others said: No, but he seduceth the people. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>Yet no man spoke openly of him, for fear of the Jews. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>Now about the midst of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple, and taught. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And the Jews wondered, saying: How doth this man know letters, having never learned? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>Jesus answered them, and said: My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>If any man do the will of him; he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>He that speaketh of himself, seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh the glory of him that sent him, he is true, and there is no injustice in him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>Did Moses not give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>Why seek you to kill me? The multitude answered, and said: Thou hast a devil; who seeketh to kill thee? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>Jesus answered, and said to them: One work I have done; and you all wonder: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>Therefore, Moses gave you circumcision (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and on the sabbath day you circumcise a man. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>If a man receive circumcision on the sabbath day, that the law of Moses may not be broken; are you angry at me because I have healed the whole man on the sabbath day? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>Judge not according to the appearance, but judge just judgment. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>Some therefore of Jerusalem said: Is not this he whom they seek to kill? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>And behold, he speaketh openly, and they say nothing to him. Have the rulers known for a truth, that this is the Christ? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>But we know this man, whence he is: but when the Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>Jesus therefore cried out in the temple, teaching, and saying: You both know me, and you know whence I am: and I am not come of myself; but he that sent me, is true, whom you know not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>I know him, because I am from him, and he hath sent me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>They sought therefore to apprehend him: and no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>But of the people many believed in him, and said: When the Christ cometh, shall he do more miracles, than these which this man doth? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>The Pharisees heard the people murmuring these things concerning him: and the rulers and Pharisees sent ministers to apprehend him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>Jesus therefore said to them: Yet a little while I am with you: and then I go to him that sent me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34 </span>You shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither you cannot come. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35 </span>The Jews therefore said among themselves: Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36 </span>What is this saying that he hath said: You shall seek me, and shall not find me; and where I am, you cannot come? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37 </span>And on the last, and great day of the festivity, Jesus stood and cried, saying: If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38 </span>He that believeth in me, as the scripture saith, Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39 </span>Now this he said of the Spirit which they should receive, who believed in him: for as yet the Spirit was not given, because Jesus was not yet glorified. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40 </span>Of that multitude therefore, when they had heard these words of his, some said: This is the prophet indeed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41 </span>Others said: This is the Christ. But some said: Doth the Christ come out of Galilee? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42 </span>Doth not the scripture say: That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem the town where David was? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="43">43 </span>So there arose a dissension among the people because of him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="44">44 </span>And some of them would have apprehended him: but no man laid hands on him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="45">45 </span>The ministers therefore came to the chief priests and the Pharisees. And they said to them: Why have you not brought him? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="46">46 </span>The ministers answered: Never did man speak like this man. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="47">47 </span>The Pharisees therefore answered them: Are you also seduced? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="48">48 </span>Hath any one of the rulers believed in him, or of the Pharisees? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="49">49 </span>But this multitude, that knoweth not the law, are accursed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="50">50 </span>Nicodemus said to them, (he that came to him by night, who was one of them:) 
<br /><span class="verse" id="51">51 </span>Doth our law judge any man, unless it first hear him, and know what he doth? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="52">52 </span>They answered, and said to him: Art thou also a Galilean? Search the scriptures, and see, that out of Galilee a prophet riseth not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="53">53 </span>And every man returned to his own house. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
