<h3>Chapter 12 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>JESUS therefore, six days before the pasch, came to Bethania, where Lazarus had been dead, whom Jesus raised to life. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And they made him a supper there: and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that were at table with him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>Mary therefore took a pound of ointment of right spikenard, of great price, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair; and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>Then one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, he that was about to betray him, said: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>Now he said this, not because he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and having the purse, carried the things that were put therein. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>Jesus therefore said: Let her alone, that she may keep it against the day of my burial. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>For the poor you have always with you; but me you have not always. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>A great multitude therefore of the Jews knew that he was there; and they came, not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>But the chief priests thought to kill Lazarus also: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>Because many of the Jews, by reason of him, went away, and believed in Jesus. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And on the next day, a great multitude that was to come to the festival day, when they had heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried: Hosanna, blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord, the king of Israel. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>And Jesus found a young ass, and sat upon it, as it is written: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy king cometh, sitting on an ass's colt. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>These things his disciples did not know at the first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things to him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>The multitude therefore gave testimony, which was with him, when he called Lazarus out of the grave, and raised him from the dead. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>For which reason also the people came to meet him, because they heard that he had done this miracle. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>The Pharisees therefore said among themselves: Do you see that we prevail nothing? behold, the whole world is gone after him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>Now there were certain Gentiles among them, who came up to adore on the festival day. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>These therefore came to Philip, who was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying: Sir, we would see Jesus. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>Philip cometh, and telleth Andrew. Again Andrew and Philip told Jesus. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>But Jesus answered them, saying: The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>Amen, amen I say to you, unless the grain of wheat falling into the ground die, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>Itself remaineth alone. But if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit. He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world, keepeth it unto life eternal. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>If any man minister to me, let him follow me; and where I am, there also shall my minister be. If any man minister to me, him will my Father honour. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>Now is my soul troubled. And what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour. But for this cause I came unto this hour. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>Father, glorify thy name. A voice therefore came from heaven: I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>The multitude therefore that stood and heard, said that it thundered. Others said: An angel spoke to him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>Jesus answered, and said: This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>Now is the judgment of the world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all things to myself. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>(Now this he said, signifying what death he should die.) 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34 </span>The multitude answered him: We have heard out of the law, that Christ abideth for ever; and how sayest thou: The Son of man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35 </span>Jesus therefore said to them: Yet a little while, the light is among you. Walk whilst you have the light, that the darkness overtake you not. And he that walketh in darkness, knoweth not whither he goeth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36 </span>Whilst you have the light, believe in the light, that you may be the children of light. These things Jesus spoke; and he went away, and hid himself from them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37 </span>And whereas he had done so many miracles before them, they believed not in him: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38 </span>That the saying of Isaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he said: Lord, who hath believed our hearing? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39 </span>Therefore they could not believe, because Isaias said again: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40 </span>He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart, that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41 </span>These things said Isaias, when he saw his glory, and spoke of him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42 </span>However, many of the chief men also believed in him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, that they might not be cast out of the synagogue. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="43">43 </span>For they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="44">44 </span>But Jesus cried, and said: He that believeth in me, doth not believe in me, but in him that sent me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="45">45 </span>And he that seeth me, seeth him that sent me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="46">46 </span>I am come a light into the world; that whosoever believeth in me, may not remain in darkness. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="47">47 </span>And if any man hear my words, and keep them not, I do not judge him: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="48">48 </span>He that despiseth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him; the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="49">49 </span>For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father who sent me, he gave me commandment what I should say, and what I should speak. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="50">50 </span>And I know that his commandment is life everlasting. The things therefore that I speak, even as the Father said unto me, so do I speak. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
