<h3>Chapter 13 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>BEFORE the festival day of the pasch, Jesus knowing that his hour was come, that he should pass out of this world to the Father: having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them unto the end. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And when supper was done, (the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, to betray him,) 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>Knowing that the Father had given him all things into his hands, and that he came from God, and goeth to God; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>He riseth from supper, and layeth aside his garments, and having taken a towel, girded himself. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>After that, he putteth water into a basin, and began to wash the feet of the disciples, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>He cometh therefore to Simon Peter. And Peter saith to him: Lord, dost thou wash my feet? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>Jesus answered, and said to him: What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>Peter saith to him: Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him: If I wash thee not, thou shalt have no part with me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>Simon Peter saith to him: Lord, not only my feet, but also my hands and my head. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>Jesus saith to him: He that is washed, needeth not but to wash his feet, but is clean wholly. And you are clean, but not all. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>For he knew who he was that would betray him; therefore he said: You are not all clean. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>Then after he had washed their feet, and taken his garments, being set down again, he said to them: Know you what I have done to you? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>You call me Master, and Lord; and you say well, for so I am. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>If then I being your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; you also ought to wash one another's feet. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>For I have given you an example, that as I have done to you, so you do also. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>Amen, amen I say to you: The servant is not greater than his lord; neither is the apostle greater than he that sent him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>If you know these things, you shall be blessed if you do them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen. But that the scripture may be fulfilled: He that eateth bread with me, shall lift up his heel against me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>At present I tell you, before it come to pass: that when it shall come to pass, you may believe that I am he. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>Amen, amen I say to you, he that receiveth whomsoever I send, receiveth me; and he that receiveth me, receiveth him that sent me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>When Jesus had said these things, he was troubled in spirit; and he testified, and said: Amen, amen I say to you, one of you shall betray me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>The disciples therefore looked one upon another, doubting of whom he spoke. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, and said to him: Who is it of whom he speaketh? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>He therefore, leaning on the breast of Jesus, saith to him: Lord, who is it? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>Jesus answered: He it is to whom I shall reach bread dipped. And when he had dipped the bread, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>And after the morsel, Satan entered into him. And Jesus said to him: That which thou dost, do quickly. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>Now no man at the table knew to what purpose he said this unto him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>For some thought, because Judas had the purse, that Jesus had said to him: Buy those things which we have need of for the festival day: or that he should give something to the poor. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>He therefore having received the morsel, went out immediately. And it was night. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>When he therefore was gone out, Jesus said: Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>If God be glorified in him, God also will glorify him in himself; and immediately will he glorify him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You shall seek me; and as I said to the Jews: Whither I go you cannot come; so I say to you now. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34 </span>A new commandment I give unto you: That you love one another, as I have loved you, that you also love one another. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35 </span>By this shall all men know that you are my disciples, if you have love one for another. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36 </span>Simon Peter saith to him: Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered: Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow hereafter. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37 </span>Peter saith to him: Why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38 </span>Jesus answered him: Wilt thou lay down thy life for me? Amen, amen I say to thee, the cock shall not crow, till thou deny me thrice. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
