<h3>Chapter 4 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>WHEN Jesus therefore understood that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus maketh more disciples, and baptizeth more than John, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>(Though Jesus himself did not baptize, but his disciples,) 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>He left Judea, and went again into Galilee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And he was of necessity to pass through Samaria. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>He cometh therefore to a city of Samaria, which is called Sichar, near the land which Jacob gave to his son Joseph. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well. It was about the sixth hour. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>There cometh a woman of Samaria, to draw water. Jesus saith to her: Give me to drink. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>For his disciples were gone into the city to buy meats. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>Then that Samaritan woman saith to him: How dost thou, being a Jew, ask of me to drink, who am a Samaritan woman? For the Jews do not communicate with the Samaritans. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>Jesus answered, and said to her: If thou didst know the gift of God, and who he is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou perhaps wouldst have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>The woman saith to him: Sir, thou hast nothing wherein to draw, and the well is deep; from whence then hast thou living water? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>Jesus answered, and said to her: Whosoever drinketh of this water, shall thirst again; but he that shall drink of the water that I will give him, shall not thirst for ever: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>But the water that I will give him, shall become in him a fountain of water, springing up into life everlasting. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>The woman saith to him: Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come hither to draw. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>Jesus saith to her: Go, call thy husband, and come hither. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>The woman answered, and said: I have no husband. Jesus said to her: Thou hast said well, I have no husband: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>For thou hast had five husbands: and he whom thou now hast, is not thy husband. This thou hast said truly. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>The woman saith to him: Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>Our fathers adored on this mountain, and you say, that at Jerusalem is the place where men must adore. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>Jesus saith to her: Woman, believe me, that the hour cometh, when you shall neither on this mountain, not in Jerusalem, adore the Father. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>You adore that which you know not: we adore that which we know; for salvation is of the Jews. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true adorers shall adore the Father in spirit and in truth. For the Father also seeketh such to adore him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>God is a spirit; and they that adore him, must adore him in spirit and in truth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>The woman saith to him: I know that the Messias cometh (who is called Christ); therefore, when he is come, he will tell us all things. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>Jesus saith to her: I am he, who am speaking with thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>And immediately his disciples came; and they wondered that he talked with the woman. Yet no man said: What seekest thou? or, why talkest thou with her? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>The woman therefore left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men there: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>Come, and see a man who has told me all things whatsoever I have done. Is not he the Christ? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>They went therefore out of the city, and came unto him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>In the mean time the disciples prayed him, saying: Rabbi, eat. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>But he said to them: I have meat to eat, which you know not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>The disciples therefore said one to another: Hath any man brought him to eat? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34 </span>Jesus saith to them: My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, that I may perfect his work. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35 </span>Do you not say, There are yet four months, and then the harvest cometh? Behold, I say to you, lift up your eyes, and see the countries; for they are white already to harvest. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36 </span>And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life everlasting: that both he that soweth, and he that reapeth, may rejoice together. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37 </span>For in this is the saying true: That it is one man that soweth, and it is another that reapeth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38 </span>I have sent you to reap that in which you did not labour: others have laboured, and you have entered into their labours. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39 </span>Now of that city many of the Samaritans believed in him, for the word of the woman giving testimony: He told me all things whatsoever I have done. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40 </span>So when the Samaritans were come to him, they desired that he would tarry there. And he abode there two days. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41 </span>And many more believed in him because of his own word. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42 </span>And they said to the woman: We now believe, not for thy saying: for we ourselves have heard him, and know that this is indeed the Saviour of the world. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="43">43 </span>Now after two days, he departed thence, and went into Galilee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="44">44 </span>For Jesus himself gave testimony that a prophet hath no honour in his own country. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="45">45 </span>And when he was come into Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all the things he had done at Jerusalem on the festival day; for they also went to the festival day. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="46">46 </span>He came again therefore into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain ruler, whose son was sick at Capharnaum. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="47">47 </span>He having heard that Jesus was come from Judea into Galilee, went to him, and prayed him to come down, and heal his son; for he was at the point of death. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="48">48 </span>Jesus therefore said to him: Unless you see signs and wonders, you believe not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="49">49 </span>The ruler saith to him: Lord, come down before that my son die. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="50">50 </span>Jesus saith to him: Go thy way; thy son liveth. The man believed the word which Jesus said to him, and went his way. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="51">51 </span>And as he was going down, his servants met him; and they brought word, saying, that his son lived. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="52">52 </span>He asked therefore of them the hour wherein he grew better. And they said to him: Yesterday, at the seventh hour, the fever left him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="53">53 </span>The father therefore knew, that it was at the same hour that Jesus said to him, Thy son liveth; and himself believed, and his whole house. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="54">54 </span>This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judea into Galilee. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
