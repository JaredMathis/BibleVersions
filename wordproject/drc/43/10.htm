<h3>Chapter 10 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>AMEN, amen I say to you: He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up another way, the same is a thief and a robber. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And when he hath let out his own sheep, he goeth before them: and the sheep follow him, because they know his voice. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>But a stranger they follow not, but fly from him, because they know not the voice of strangers. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>This proverb Jesus spoke to them. But they understood not what he spoke to them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>Jesus therefore said to them again: Amen, amen I say to you, I am the door of the sheep. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>All others, as many as have come, are thieves and robbers: and the sheep heard them not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>I am the door. By me, if any man enter in, he shall be saved: and he shall go in, and go out, and shall find pastures. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy. I am come that they may have life, and may have it more abundantly. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd giveth his life for his sheep. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>But the hireling, and he that is not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and flieth: and the wolf catcheth, and scattereth the sheep: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And the hireling flieth, because he is a hireling: and he hath no care for the sheep. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>I am the good shepherd; and I know mine, and mine know me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>As the Father knoweth me, and I know the Father: and I lay down my life for my sheep. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>And other sheep I have, that are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice, and there shall be one fold and one shepherd. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>Therefore doth the Father love me: because I lay down my life, that I may take it again. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>No man taketh it away from me: but I lay it down of myself, and I have power to lay it down: and I have power to take it up again. This commandment have I received of my Father. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>A dissension rose again among the Jews for these words. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>And many of them said: He hath a devil, and is mad: why hear you him? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>Others said: These are not the words of one that hath a devil: Can a devil open the eyes of the blind? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>And it was the feast of the dedication at Jerusalem: and it was winter. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>And Jesus walked in the temple, in Solomon's porch. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>The Jews therefore came round about him, and said to him: How long dost thou hold our souls in suspense? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>Jesus answered them: I speak to you, and you believe not: the works that I do in the name of my Father, they give testimony of me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>But you do not believe, because you are not of my sheep. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>My sheep hear my voice: and I know them, and they follow me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>And I give them life everlasting; and they shall not perish for ever, and no man shall pluck them out of my hand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>That which my Father hath given me, is greater than all: and no one can snatch them out of the hand of my Father. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>I and the Father are one. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>The Jews then took up stones to stone him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>Jesus answered them: Many good works I have shewed you from my Father; for which of these works do you stone me? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>The Jews answered him: For a good work we stone thee not, but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, maketh thyself God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34 </span>Jesus answered them: Is it not written in your law: I said you are gods? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35 </span>If he called them gods, to whom to word of God was spoken, and the scripture cannot be broken; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36 </span>Do you say of him whom the Father hath sanctified and sent into the world: Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37 </span>If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38 </span>But if I do, though you will not believe me, believe the works: that you may know and believe that the Father is in me, and I in the Father. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39 </span>They sought therefore to take him; and he escaped out of their hands. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40 </span>And he went again beyond the Jordan, into that place where John was baptizing first; and there he abode. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41 </span>And many resorted to him, and they said: John indeed did no sign. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42 </span>But all things whatsoever John said of this man, were true. And many believed in him. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
