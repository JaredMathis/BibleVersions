<h3>Chapter 17 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>THESE things Jesus spoke, and lifting up his eyes to heaven, he said: Father, the hour is come, glorify thy Son, that thy Son may glorify thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he may give eternal life to all whom thou hast given him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>Now this is eternal life: That they may know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>I have glorified thee on the earth; I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>And now glorify thou me, O Father, with thyself, with the glory which I had, before the world was, with thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>I have manifested thy name to the men whom thou hast given me out of the world. Thine they were, and to me thou gavest them; and they have kept thy word. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>Now they have known, that all things which thou hast given me, are from thee: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>Because the words which thou gavest me, I have given to them; and they have received them, and have known in very deed that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them whom thou hast given me: because they are thine: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>And all my things are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And now I am not in the world, and these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep them in thy name whom thou has given me; that they may be one, as we also are. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>While I was with them, I kept them in thy name. Those whom thou gavest me have I kept; and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition, that the scripture may be fulfilled. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And now I come to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy filled in themselves. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>I have given them thy word, and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world; as I also am not of the world. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>I pray not that thou shouldst take them out of the world, but that thou shouldst keep them from evil. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>They are not of the world, as I also am not of the world. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>Sanctify them in truth. Thy word is truth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>As thou hast sent me into the world, I also have sent them into the world. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>And for them do I sanctify myself, that they also may be sanctified in truth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>And not for them only do I pray, but for them also who through their word shall believe in me; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>That they all may be one, as thou, Father, in me, and I in thee; that they also may be one in us; that the world may believe that thou hast sent me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>And the glory which thou hast given me, I have given to them; that they may be one, as we also are one: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>I in them, and thou in me; that they may be made perfect in one: and the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast also loved me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>Father, I will that where I am, they also whom thou hast given me may be with me; that they may see my glory which thou hast given me, because thou hast loved me before the creation of the world. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>Just Father, the world hath not known thee; but I have known thee: and these have known that thou hast sent me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>And I have made known thy name to them, and will make it known; that the love wherewith thou hast loved me, may be in them, and I in them. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
