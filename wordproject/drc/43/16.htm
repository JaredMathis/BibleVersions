<h3>Chapter 16 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>THESE things have I spoken to you, that you may not be scandalized. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>They will put you out of the synagogues: yea, the hour cometh, that whosoever killeth you, will think that he doth a service to God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>And these things will they do to you; because they have not known the Father, nor me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>But these things I have told you, that when the hour shall come, you may remember that I told you of them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>But I told you not these things from the beginning, because I was with you. And now I go to him that sent me, and none of you asketh me: Whither goest thou? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>But because I have spoken these things to you, sorrow hath filled your heart. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>But I tell you the truth: it is expedient to you that I go: for if I go not, the Paraclete will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And when he is come, he will convince the world of sin, and of justice, and of judgment. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>Of sin: because they believed not in me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>And of justice: because I go to the Father; and you shall see me no longer. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And of judgment: because the prince of this world is already judged. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>I have yet many things to say to you: but you cannot bear them now. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>But when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will teach you all truth. For he shall not speak of himself; but what things soever he shall hear, he shall speak; and the things that are to come, he shall shew you. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>He shall glorify me; because he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it to you. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>All things whatsoever the Father hath, are mine. Therefore I said, that he shall receive of mine, and shew it to you. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>A little while, and now you shall not see me; and again a little while, and you shall see me: because I go to the Father. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>Then some of the disciples said one to another: What is this that he saith to us: A little while, and you shall not see me; and again a little while, and you shall see me, and, because I go to the Father? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>They said therefore: What is this that he saith, A little while? we know not what he speaketh. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>And Jesus knew that they had a mind to ask him; and he said to them: Of this do you inquire among yourselves, because I said: A little while, and you shall not see me; and again a little while, and you shall see me? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>Amen, amen I say to you, that you shall lament and weep, but the world shall rejoice; and you shall be made sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>A woman, when she is in labour, hath sorrow, because her hour is come; but when she hath brought forth the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>So also you now indeed have sorrow; but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice; and your joy no man shall take from you. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>And in that day you shall not ask me any thing. Amen, amen I say to you: if you ask the Father any thing in my name, he will give it you. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>Hitherto you have not asked any thing in my name. Ask, and you shall receive; that your joy may be full. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>These things I have spoken to you in proverbs. The hour cometh, when I will no more speak to you in proverbs, but will shew you plainly of the Father. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>In that day you shall ask in my name; and I say not to you, that I will ask the Father for you: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>For the Father himself loveth you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again I leave the world, and I go to the Father. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>His disciples say to him: Behold, now thou speakest plainly, and speakest no proverb. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>Now we know that thou knowest all things, and thou needest not that any man should ask thee. By this we believe that thou camest forth from God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>Jesus answered them: Do you now believe? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>Behold, the hour cometh, and it is now come, that you shall be scattered every man to his own, and shall leave me alone; and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>These things I have spoken to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you shall have distress: but have confidence, I have overcome the world. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
