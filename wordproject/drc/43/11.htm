<h3>Chapter 11 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>NOW there was a certain man sick, named Lazarus, of Bethania, of the town of Mary and Martha her sister. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>(And Mary was she that anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair: whose brother Lazarus was sick.) 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>His sisters therefore sent to him, saying: Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And Jesus hearing it, said to them: This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God: that the Son of God may be glorified by it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister Mary, and Lazarus. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he still remained in the same place two days. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>Then after that, he said to his disciples: Let us go into Judea again. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>The disciples say to him: Rabbi, the Jews but now sought to stone thee: and goest thou thither again? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>Jesus answered: Are there not twelve hours of the day? If a man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>But if he walk in the night, he stumbleth, because the light is not in him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>These things he said; and after that he said to them: Lazarus our friend sleepeth; but I go that I may awake him out of sleep. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>His disciples therefore said: Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>But Jesus spoke of his death; and they thought that he spoke of the repose of sleep. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>Then therefore Jesus said to them plainly: Lazarus is dead. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And I am glad, for your sakes, that I was not there, that you may believe: but let us go to him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>Thomas therefore, who is called Didymus, said to his fellow disciples: Let us also go, that we may die with him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>Jesus therefore came, and found that he had been four days already in the grave. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>(Now Bethania was near Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off.) 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>And many of the Jews were come to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>Martha therefore, as soon as she heard that Jesus had come, went to meet him: but Mary sat at home. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>Martha therefore said to Jesus: Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>But now also I know that whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>Jesus saith to her: Thy brother shall rise again. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>Martha saith to him: I know that he shall rise again, in the resurrection at the last day. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>Jesus said to her: I am the resurrection and the life: he that believeth in me, although he be dead, shall live: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>And every one that liveth, and believeth in me, shall not die for ever. Believest thou this? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>She saith to him: Yea, Lord, I have believed that thou art Christ the Son of the living God, who art come into this world. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>And when she had said these things, she went, and called her sister Mary secretly, saying: The master is come, and calleth for thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>She, as soon as she heard this, riseth quickly, and cometh to him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>For Jesus was not yet come into the town: but he was still in that place where Martha had met him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>The Jews therefore, who were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary that she rose up speedily and went out, followed her, saying: She goeth to the grave to weep there. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>When Mary therefore was come where Jesus was, seeing him, she fell down at his feet, and saith to him: Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>Jesus, therefore, when he saw her weeping, and the Jews that were come with her, weeping, groaned in the spirit, and troubled himself, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34 </span>And said: Where have you laid him? They say to him: Lord, come and see. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35 </span>And Jesus wept. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36 </span>The Jews therefore said: Behold how he loved him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37 </span>But some of them said: Could not he that opened the eyes of the man born blind, have caused that this man should not die? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38 </span>Jesus therefore again groaning in himself, cometh to the sepulchre. Now it was a cave; and a stone was laid over it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39 </span>Jesus saith: Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith to him: Lord, by this time he stinketh, for he is now of four days. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40 </span>Jesus saith to her: Did not I say to thee, that if thou believe, thou shalt see the glory of God? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41 </span>They took therefore the stone away. And Jesus lifting up his eyes said: Father, I give thee thanks that thou hast heard me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42 </span>And I knew that thou hearest me always; but because of the people who stand about have I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="43">43 </span>When he had said these things, he cried with a loud voice: Lazarus, come forth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="44">44 </span>And presently he that had been dead came forth, bound feet and hands with winding bands; and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus said to them: Loose him, and let him go. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="45">45 </span>Many therefore of the Jews, who were come to Mary and Martha, and had seen the things that Jesus did, believed in him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="46">46 </span>But some of them went to the Pharisees, and told them the things that Jesus had done. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="47">47 </span>The chief priests therefore, and the Pharisees, gathered a council, and said: What do we, for this man doth many miracles? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="48">48 </span>If we let him alone so, all will believe in him; and the Romans will come, and take away our place and nation. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="49">49 </span>But one of them, named Caiphas, being the high priest that year, said to them: You know nothing. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="50">50 </span>Neither do you consider that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="51">51 </span>And this he spoke not of himself: but being the high priest of that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="52">52 </span>And not only for the nation, but to gather together in one the children of God, that were dispersed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="53">53 </span>From that day therefore they devised to put him to death. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="54">54 </span>Wherefore Jesus walked no more openly among the Jews; but he went into a country near the desert, unto a city that is called Ephrem, and there he abode with his disciples. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="55">55 </span>And the pasch of the Jews was at hand; and many from the country went up to Jerusalem, before the pasch to purify themselves. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="56">56 </span>They sought therefore for Jesus; and they discoursed one with another, standing in the temple: What think you that he is not come to the festival day? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="57">57 </span>And the chief priests and Pharisees had given a commandment, that if any man knew where he was, he should tell, that they might apprehend him. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
