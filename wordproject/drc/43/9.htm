<h3>Chapter 9 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>AND Jesus passing by, saw a man, who was blind from his birth: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And his disciples asked him: Rabbi, who hath sinned, this man, or his parents, that he should be born blind? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>Jesus answered: Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents; but that the works of God should be made manifest in him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>I must work the works of him that sent me, whilst it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>When he had said these things, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and spread the clay on his eyes, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>And said to him: Go, wash in the pool of Siloe, which is interpreted, Sent. He went therefore, and washed, and he came seeing. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>The neighbours therefore, and they who had seen him before that he was a beggar, said: Is not this he that sat and begged? Some said: This is he. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>But others said: No, but he is like him. But he said: I am he. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>They said therefore to him: How were thy eyes opened? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>He answered: That man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed my eyes, and said to me: Go to the pool of Siloe, and wash. And I went, I washed, and I see. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And they said to him: Where is he? He saith: I know not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>They bring him that had been blind to the Pharisees. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>Now it was the sabbath, when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>Again therefore the Pharisees asked him, how he had received his sight. But he said to them: He put clay upon my eyes, and I washed, and I see. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>Some therefore of the Pharisees said: This man is not of God, who keepeth not the sabbath. But others said: How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>They say therefore to the blind man again: What sayest thou of him that hath opened they eyes? And he said: He is a prophet. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>The Jews then did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>And asked them, saying: Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then doth he now see? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>His parents answered them, and said: We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>But how he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: ask himself: he is of age, let him speak for himself. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>These things his parents said, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had already agreed among themselves, that if any man should confess him to be Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>Therefore did his parents say: He is of age, ask himself. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>They therefore called the man again that had been blind, and said to him: Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>He said therefore to them: If he be a sinner, I know not: one thing I know, that whereas I was blind, now I see. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>They said then to him: What did he to thee? How did he open thy eyes? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>He answered them: I have told you already, and you have heard: why would you hear it again? will you also become his disciples? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>They reviled him therefore, and said: Be thou his disciple; but we are the disciples of Moses. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>We know that God spoke to Moses: but as to this man, we know not from whence he is. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>The man answered, and said to them: Why, herein is a wonderful thing, that you know not from whence he is, and he hath opened my eyes. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>Now we know that God doth not hear sinners: but if a man be a server of God, and doth his will, him he heareth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>From the beginning of the world it hath not been heard, that any man hath opened the eyes of one born blind. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>Unless this man were of God, he could not do any thing. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34 </span>They answered, and said to him: Thou wast wholly born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35 </span>Jesus heard that they had cast him out: and when he had found him, he said to him: Dost thou believe in the Son of God? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36 </span>He answered, and said: Who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37 </span>And Jesus said to him: Thou hast both seen him; and it is he that talketh with thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38 </span>And he said: I believe, Lord. And falling down, he adored him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39 </span>And Jesus said: For judgment I am come into this world; that they who see not, may see; and they who see, may become blind. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40 </span>And some of the Pharisees, who were with him, heard: and they said unto him: Are we also blind? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41 </span>Jesus said to them: If you were blind, you should not have sin: but now you say: We see. Your sin remaineth. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
