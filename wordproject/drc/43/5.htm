<h3>Chapter 5 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>AFTER these things was a festival day of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>Now there is at Jerusalem a pond, called Probatica, which in Hebrew is named Bethsaida, having five porches. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>In these lay a great multitude of sick, of blind, of lame, of withered; waiting for the moving of the water. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And an angel of the Lord descended at certain times into the pond; and the water was moved. And he that went down first into the pond after the motion of the water, was made whole, of whatsoever infirmity he lay under. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>And there was a certain man there, that had been eight and thirty years under his infirmity. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>Him when Jesus had seen lying, and knew that he had been now a long time, he saith to him: Wilt thou be made whole? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>The infirm man answered him: Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pond. For whilst I am coming, another goeth down before me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>Jesus saith to him: Arise, take up thy bed, and walk. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>And immediately the man was made whole: and he took up his bed, and walked. And it was the sabbath that day. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>The Jews therefore said to him that was healed: It is the sabbath; it is not lawful for thee to take up thy bed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>He answered them: He that made me whole, he said to me, Take up thy bed, and walk. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>They asked him therefore: Who is that man who said to thee, Take up thy bed, and walk? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>But he who was healed, knew not who it was; for Jesus went aside from the multitude standing in the place. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>Afterwards, Jesus findeth him in the temple, and saith to him: Behold thou art made whole: sin no more, lest some worse thing happen to thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>The man went his way, and told the Jews, that it was Jesus who had made him whole. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>Therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, because he did these things on the sabbath. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>But Jesus answered them: My Father worketh until now; and I work. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>Hereupon therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he did not only break the sabbath, but also said God was his Father, making himself equal to God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>Then Jesus answered, and said to them: Amen, amen, I say unto you, the Son cannot do any thing of himself, but what he seeth the Father doing: for what things soever he doth, these the Son also doth in like manner. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things which himself doth: and greater works than these will he shew him, that you may wonder. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and giveth life: so the Son also giveth life to whom he will. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>For neither doth the Father judge any man, but hath given all judgment to the Son. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>That all men may honour the Son, as they honour the Father. He who honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father, who hath sent him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>Amen, amen I say unto you, that he who heareth my word, and believeth him that sent me, hath life everlasting; and cometh not into judgment, but is passed from death to life. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>Amen, amen I say unto you, that the hour cometh, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>For as the Father hath life in himself, so he hath given the Son also to have life in himself: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>And he hath given him power to do judgment, because he is the Son of man. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>Wonder not at this; for the hour cometh, wherein all that are in the graves shall hear the voice of the Son of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>And they that have done good things, shall come forth unto the resurrection of life; but they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of judgment. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>I cannot of myself do any thing. As I hear, so I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not my own will, but the will of him that sent me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>You sent to John, and he gave testimony to the truth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34 </span>But I receive not testimony from man: but I say these things, that you may be saved. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35 </span>He was a burning and a shining light: and you were willing for a time to rejoice in his light. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36 </span>But I have a greater testimony than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to perfect; the works themselves, which I do, give testimony of me, that the Father hath sent me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37 </span>And the Father himself who hath sent me, hath given testimony of me: neither have you heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38 </span>And you have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him you believe not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39 </span>Search the scriptures, for you think in them to have life everlasting; and the same are they that give testimony of me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40 </span>And you will not come to me that you may have life. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41 </span>I receive glory not from men. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42 </span>But I know you, that you have not the love of God in you. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="43">43 </span>I am come in the name of my Father, and you receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him you will receive. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="44">44 </span>How can you believe, who receive glory one from another: and the glory which is from God alone, you do not seek? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="45">45 </span>Think not that I will accuse you to the Father. There is one that accuseth you, Moses, in whom you trust. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="46">46 </span>For if you did believe Moses, you would perhaps believe me also; for he wrote of me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="47">47 </span>But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my words? </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
