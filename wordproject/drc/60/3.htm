<h3>Chapter 3 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>In like manner also let wives be subject to their husbands: that if any believe not the word, they may be won without the word, by the conversation of the wives. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>Considering your chaste conversation with fear. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>Whose adorning let it not be the outward plaiting of the hair, or the wearing of gold, or the putting on of apparel: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>But the hidden man of the heart in the incorruptibility of a quiet and a meek spirit, which is rich in the sight of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>For after this manner heretofore the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>As Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters you are, doing well, and not fearing any disturbance. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>Ye husbands, likewise dwelling with them according to knowledge, giving honour to the female as to the weaker vessel, and as to the co-heirs of the grace of life: that your prayers be not hindered. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And in fine, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, being lovers of the brotherhood, merciful, modest, humble: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>Not rendering evil for evil, nor railing for railing, but contrariwise, blessing: for unto this are you called, that you may inherit a blessing. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>Let him decline from evil, and do good: let him seek after peace and pursue it: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>Because the eyes of the Lord are upon the just, and his ears unto their prayers: but the countenance of the Lord upon them that do evil things. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And who is he that can hurt you, if you be zealous of good? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>But if also you suffer any thing for justice' sake, blessed are ye. And be not afraid of their fear, and be not troubled. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>But sanctify the Lord Christ in your hearts, being ready always to satisfy every one that asketh you a reason of that hope which is in you. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>But with modesty and fear, having a good conscience: that whereas they speak evil of you, they may be ashamed who falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>For it is better doing well (if such be the will of God) to suffer, than doing ill. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>Because Christ also died once for our sins, the just for the unjust: that he might offer us to God, being put to death indeed in the flesh, but enlivened in the spirit, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>In which also coming he preached to those spirits that were in prison: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>Which had been some time incredulous, when they waited for the patience of God in the days of Noe, when the ark was a building: wherein a few, that is, eight souls, were saved by water. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>Whereunto baptism being of the like form, now saveth you also: not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the examination of a good conscience towards God by the resurrection of Jesus Christ. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>Who is on the right hand of God, swallowing down death, that we might be made heirs of life everlasting: being gone into heaven, the angels and powers and virtues being made subject to him. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
