<h3>Chapter 2 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>Wherefore laying away all malice, and all guile, and dissimulations, and envies, and all detractions, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>As newborn babes, desire the rational milk without guile, that thereby you may grow unto salvation: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>If so be you have tasted that the Lord is sweet. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>Unto whom coming, as to a living stone, rejected indeed by men, but chosen and made honourable by God: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>Be you also as living stones built up, a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>Wherefore it is said in the scripture: Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious. And he that shall believe in him, shall not be confounded. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>To you therefore that believe, he is honour: but to them that believe not, the stone which the builders rejected, the same is made the head of the corner: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of scandal, to them who stumble at the word, neither do believe, whereunto also they are set. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>But you are a chosen generation, a kingly priesthood, a holy nation, a purchased people: that you may declare his virtues, who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>Who in time past were not a people: but are now the people of God. Who had not obtained mercy; but now have obtained mercy. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, to refrain yourselves from carnal desires which war against the soul, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>Having your conversation good among the Gentiles: that whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may, by the good works, which they shall behold in you, glorify God in the day of visitation. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>Be ye subject therefore to every human creature for God's sake: whether it be to the king as excelling; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>Or to governors as sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of the good: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>For so is the will of God, that by doing well you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>As free, and not as making liberty a cloak for malice, but as the servants of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>For this is thankworthy, if for conscience towards God, a man endure sorrows, suffering wrongfully. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>For what glory is it, if committing sin, and being buffeted for it, you endure? But if doing well you suffer patiently; this is thankworthy before God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>For unto this are you called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving you an example that you should follow his steps. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>Who, when he was reviled, did not revile: when he suffered, he threatened not: but delivered himself to him that judged him unjustly. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>Who his own self bore our sins in his body upon the tree: that we, being dead to sins, should live to justice: by whose stripes you were healed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>For you were as sheep going astray; but you are now converted to the shepherd and bishop of your souls. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
