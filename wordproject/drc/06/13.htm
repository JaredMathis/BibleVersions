<h3>Chapter 13 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>Josue was old, and far advanced in years, and the Lord said to him: Thou art grown old, and advanced in age, and there is a very large country left, which is not yet divided by lot: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>To wit, all Galilee, Philistia, and all Gessuri. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>From the troubled river, that watereth Egypt, unto the borders of Accaron northward: the land of Chanaan, which is divided among the lords of the Philistines, the Gazites, the Azotians, the Ascalonites, the Gethites, and the Accronites. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And on the south side are the Hevites, all the land of Chanaan, and Maara of the Sidonians as far as Apheca, and the borders of the Amorrhite, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>And his confines. The country also of Libanus towards the east from Baalgad under mount Hermon to the entering into Emath. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>Of all that dwell in the mountains from Libanus, to the waters of Maserephoth, and all the Sidonians. I am he that will cut them off from before the face of the children of Israel. So let their land come in as a part of the inheritance of Israel, as I have commanded thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>And now divide the land in possession to the nine tribes, and to the half tribe of Manasses, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>With whom Ruben and Gad have possessed the land, which Moses the servant of the Lord delivered to them beyond the river Jordan, on the east side. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>From Aroer, which is upon the bank of the torrent Amen, and in the midst of the valley and all the plains of Medaba, as far as Dibon: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>And all the cities of Sehon, king of the Amorrhites, who reigned in Hesebon, unto the borders of the children of Ammon. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And Galaad, and the borders of Gessuri and Machati, and all mount Hermon, and all Basan as far as Salecha, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>All the kingdom of Og in Basan, who reigned in Astaroth and Edrai, he was of the remains of the Raphaims: and Moses overthrew and destroyed them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And the children of Israel would not destroy Gessuri and Machati: and they have dwelt in the midst of Israel, until this present day. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>But to the tribe of Levi he gave no possession: but the sacrifices and victims of the Lord God of Israel, are his inheritance, as he spoke to him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And Moses gave a possession to the children of Ruben according to their kindreds. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>And their border was from Aroer, which is on the bank of the torrent Arnon, and in the midst of the valley of the same torrent: all the plain, that leadeth to Medaba, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And Hesebon, and all their villages, which are in the plains. Dibon also, and Bamothbaal, and the town of Baalmaon, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>And Jassa, and Cidimoth, and Mephaath, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>And Cariathaim, and Sabama, and Sarathasar in the mountain of the valley. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>Bethphogor and Asedoth, Phasga and Bethiesimoth, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>And all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdoms of Sehon king of the Amorrhites, that reigned in Hesebon, whom Moses slew with the princes of Madian: Hevi, and Recem, and Sur and Hur, and Rebe, dukes of Sehon inhabitants of the land. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>Balaam also the son of Beer the soothsayer, the children of Israel slew with the sword among the rest that were slain. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>And the river Jordan was the herder of the children of Ruben. This is the possession of the Rubenites, by their kindreds, of cities and villages. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>And Moses gave to the tribe of Gad and to his children by their kindreds a possession, of which this is the division. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>The border of Jaser, and all the cities of Galaad, and half the land of the children of Ammon: as far as Aroer which is over against Rabba: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>And from Hesebon unto Ramoth, Masphe and Betonim: and from Manaim unto the borders of Dabir. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>And in the valley Betharan and Bethnemra, and Socoth, and Saphon the other part of the kingdom of Sehon king of Hesebon: the limit of this also is the Jordan, as far as the uttermost part of the sea of Cenereth beyond the Jordan on the east side. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>This is the possession of the children of Gad by their families, their cities, and villages. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>He gave also to the half tribe of Manasses and his children possession according to their kindreds, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>The beginning whereof is this: from Manaim all Basan, and all the kingdoms of Og king of Basan, and all the villages of Jair, which are in Basan, threescore towns. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>And half Galaad, and Astaroth, and Edrai, cities of the kingdom of Og in Basan: to the children of Machir, the son of Manasses, to one? half of the children of Machir according to their kindreds. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>This possession Moses divided in the plains of Moab, beyond the Jordan, over against Jericho on the east side. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>But to the tribe of Levi he gave no possession: because the Lord the God of Israel himself is their possession, as he spoke to them. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
