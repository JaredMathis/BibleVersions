<h3>Chapter 19 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>In the third month of the departure of Israel out of the land of Egypt, on this day they came into the wilderness of Sinai: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>For departing out of Raphidim, and coming to the desert of Sinai, they camped in the same place, and there Israel pitched their tents over against the mountain. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>And Moses went up to God: and the Lord called unto him from the mountain, and said: Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>You have seen what I have done to the Egyptians, how I have carried you upon the wings of eagles, and have taken you to myself. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>If therefore you will hear my voice, and keep my covenant, you shall be my peculiar possession above all people: for all the earth is mine. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>And you shall be to me a priestly kingdom, and a holy nation. Those are the words thou shalt speak to the children of Israel. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>Moses came, and calling together the elders of the people, he declared all the words which the Lord had commanded. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And all the people answered together: All that the Lord hath spoken, we will do. And when Moses had related the people's words to the Lord, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>The Lord said to him: Lo, now will I come to thee in the darkness of a cloud, that the people may hear me speaking to thee, and may believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people to the Lord. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>And he said to him: Go to the people, and sanctify them to day, and to morrow, and let them wash their garments. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And let them be ready against the third day: for on the third day the Lord will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And thou shalt appoint certain limits to the people round about, and thou shalt say to them: Take heed you go not up into the mount, and that ye touch not the borders thereof: every one that toucheth the mount dying he shall die. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>No hands shall touch him, but he shall be stoned to death, or shall be shot through with arrows: whether it be beast, or man, he shall not live. When the trumpet shall begin to sound, then let them go up into the mount. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>And Moses came down from the mount to the people, and sanctified them. And when they had washed their garments, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>He said to them: Be ready against the third day, and come not near your wives. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>And now the third day was come, and the morning appeared: and behold thunders began to be heard, and lightning to flash, and a very thick cloud to cover the mount, and the noise of the trumpet sounded exceeding loud, and the people that was in the camp, feared. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And when Moses had brought them forth to meet God from the place of the camp, they stood at the bottom of the mount. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>And all mount Sinai was on a smoke: because the Lord was come down upon it in fire, and the smoke arose from it as out of a furnace: and all the mount was terrible. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>And the sound of the trumpet grew by degrees louder and louder, and was drawn out to a greater length: Moses spoke, and God answered him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>And the Lord came down upon mount Sinai, in the very top of the mount, and he called Moses unto the top thereof. And when he was gone up thither, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>He said unto him: Go down, and charge the people: lest they should have a mind to pass the limits to see the Lord, and a very great multitude of them should perish. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>The priests also that come to the Lord, let them be sanctified, lest he strike them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>And Moses said to the Lord: The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou did charge, and command, saying: Set limits about the mount, and sanctify it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>And the Lord said to him: Go, get thee down: and thou shalt come up, thou and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the people pass the limits, nor come up to the Lord, lest he kill them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>And Moses went down to the people and told them all. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
