<h3>Chapter 4 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>Moses answered and said: They will not believe me, nor hear my voice, but they will say: The Lord hath not appeared to thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>Then he said to him: What is that thou holdest in thy hand? He answered: A rod. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>And the Lord said: Cast it down upon the ground. He cast it down, and it was turned into a serpent: so that Moses fled from it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And the Lord said: Put out thy hand and take it by the tail. He put forth his hand, and took hold of it, and it was turned into a rod. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>That they may believe, saith he, that the Lord God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared to thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>And the Lord said again: Put thy hand into thy bosom. And when he had put it into his bosom, he brought it forth leprous as snow. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>And he said: Put back thy hand into thy bosom. He put it back, and brought it out again, and it was like the other flesh. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>If they will not believe thee, saith he, nor hear the voice of the former sign, they will believe the word of the latter sign. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>But if they will not even believe these two signs, nor hear thy voice: take of the river water, and pour it out upon the dry land, and whatsoever thou drawest out of the river shall be turned into blood. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>Moses said: I beseech thee, Lord. I am not eloquent from yesterday and the day before: and since thou hast spoken to thy servant, I have more impediment and slowness of tongue. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>The Lord said to him: Who made man's mouth? or who made the dumb and the deaf, the seeing and the blind? did not I? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>Go therefore and I will be in thy mouth: and I will teach thee what thou shalt speak. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>But he said: I beseech thee, Lord send whom thou wilt send. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>The Lord being angry at Moses, said Aaron the Levite is thy brother, I know that he is eloquent: behold he cometh forth to meet thee, and seeing thee shall be glad at heart. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>Speak to him, and put my words in his mouth: and I will be in thy mouth, and in his mouth, and will shew you what you must do. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>He shall speak in thy stead to the people, and shall be thy mouth: but thou shalt be to him in those things that pertain to God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And take this rod in thy hand, wherewith thou shalt do the signs. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>Moses went his way, and returned to Jethro his father in law and said to him: I will go and return to my brethren into Egypt, that I may see if they be yet alive. And Jethro said to him: Go in peace. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>And the Lord said to Moses, in Madian: Go, and return into Egypt: for they are all dead that sought thy life. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>Moses therefore took his wife, and his sons, and set them upon an ass: and returned into Egypt, carrying the rod of God in his hand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>And the Lord said to him as he was returning into Egypt: See that thou do all the wonders before Pharao, which I have put in thy hand: I shall harden his heart, and he will not let the people go. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>And thou shalt say to him: Thus saith the Lord: Israel is my son, my firstborn. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>I have said to thee: Let my son go, that he may serve me, and thou wouldst not let him go: behold I will kill thy son, thy firstborn. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>And when he was in his journey, in the inn, the Lord met him, and would have killed him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>Immediately Sephora took a very sharp stone, and circumcised the fore skin of her son, and touched his feet and said: A bloody spouse art thou to me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>And he let him go after she had said A bloody spouse art thou to me, because of the circumcision. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>And the Lord said to Aaron: Go into the desert to meet Moses. And he went forth to meet him in the mountain of God, and kissed him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>And Moses told Aaron all the words of the Lord, by which he had sent him, and the signs that he had commanded. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>And they came together, and they assembled all the ancients of the children of Israel. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>And Aaron spoke all the words which the Lord had said to Moses: and he wrought the signs before the people, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>And the people believed. And they heard that the Lord had visited the children of Israel: and that he had looked upon their affliction: and falling down they adored. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
