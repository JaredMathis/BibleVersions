<h3>Chapter 2 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>After this there went a man of the house of Levi; and took a wife of his own kindred. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And she conceived, and bore a son; and seeing him a goodly child hid him three months. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>And when she could hide him no longer, she took a basket made of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and pitch: and put the little babe therein, and laid him in the sedges by the river's brink, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>His sister standing afar off, and taking notice what would be done. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>And behold the daughter of Pharao came down to wash herself in the river: and her maids walked by the river's brink. And when she saw the basket in the sedges, she sent one of her maids for it: and when it was brought, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>She opened it and seeing within it an infant crying, having compassion on it she said: This is one of the babes of the Hebrews. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>And the child's sister said to her Shall I go and call to thee a Hebrew woman, to nurse the babe ? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>She answered: Go. The maid went and called her mother. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>And Pharao's daughter said to her. Take this child and nurse him for me: I will give thee thy wages. The woman took, and nursed the child: and when he was grown up, she delivered him to Pharao's daughter. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>And she adopted him for a son, and called him Moses, saying: Because I took him out of the water. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>In those days after Moses was grown up, he went out to his brethren: and saw their affliction, and an Egyptian striking one of the Hebrews his brethren. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And when he had looked about this way and that way, and saw no one there, he slew the Egyptian and hid him in the sand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And going out the next day, he saw two Hebrews quarreling: and he said to him that did the wrong: Why strikest thou thy neighbour? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>But he answered: Who hath appointed thee prince and judge over us: wilt thou kill me, as thou didst yesterday kill the Egyptian? Moses feared, and said: How is this come to be known ? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And Pharao heard of this word and sought to kill Moses: but he fled from his sight, and abode in the land of Madian, and he sat down by a well. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>And the priest of Madian had seven daughters, who came to draw water: and when the troughs were filled, desired to water their father's flocks. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And the shepherds came and drove them away: and Moses arose, and defending the maids, watered their sheep. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>And when they returned to Raguel their father, he said to them: Why are ye come sooner than usual? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>They answered: A man of Egypt delivered us from the hands of the shepherds: and he drew water also with us, and gave the sheep to drink. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>But he said: Where is he? why have you let the man go? call him that he may eat bread. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>And Moses swore that he would dwell with him. And he took Sephora his daughter to wife: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>And she bore him a son, whom he called Gersam, saying: I have been a stranger in a foreign country. And she bore another, whom he called Eliezer, saying: For the God of my father, my helper hath delivered me out of the hand of Pharao. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>Now after a long time the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel groaning, cried out because of the works: and their cry went up unto God from the works. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>And he heard their groaning, and remembered the covenant which he made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>And the Lord looked upon the children of Israel, and he knew them. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
