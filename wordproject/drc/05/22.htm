<h3>Chapter 22 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>Thou shalt not pass by if thou seest thy brother's ox, or his sheep go astray: but thou shalt bring them back to thy brother. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And if thy brother be not nigh, or thou know him not: thou shalt bring them to thy house, and they shall be with thee until thy brother seek them, and receive them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>Thou shalt do in like manner with his ass, and with his raiment, and with every thing that is thy brother's, which is lost: if thou find it, neglect it not as pertaining to another. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>If thou see thy brother's ass or his ox to be fallen down in the way, thou shalt not slight it, but shalt lift it up with him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>A woman shall not be clothed with man's apparel, neither shall a man use woman's apparel : for he that doeth these things is abominable before God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>If thou find as thou walkest by the way, a bird's nest in a tree, or on the ground, and the dam sitting upon the young or upon the eggs: thou shalt not take her with her young: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>But shalt let her go, keeping the young which thou hast caught: that it may be well with thee, and thou mayst live a long time. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>When thou buildest a new house, thou shalt make a battlement to the roof round about: lest blood be shed in thy house, and thou be guilty, if any one slip, and fall down headlong. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with divers seeds: lest both the seed which thou hast sown, and the fruit of the vineyard, be sanctified together. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>Thou shalt not plough with an ox and an ass together. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>Thou shalt not wear a garment that is woven of woollen and linen together. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>Thou shalt make strings in the hem at the four corners of thy cloak, wherewith thou shalt be covered. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>If a man marry a wife, and afterwards hate her, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>And seek occasions to put her away, laying to her charge a very ill name, and say: I took this woman to wife, and going in to her, I found her not a virgin: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>Her father and mother shall take her, and shall bring with them the tokens of her virginity to the ancients of the city that are in the gate: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>And the father shall say: I gave my daughter unto this man to wife: and because he hateth her, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>He layeth to her charge a very ill name, so as to say: I found not thy daughter a virgin: and behold these are the tokens of my daughter's virginity. And they shall spread the cloth before the ancients of the city: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>And the ancients of that city shall take that man, and beat him, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>Condemning him besides in a hundred sides of silver, which he shall give to the damsel's father, because he hath defamed by a very ill name a virgin of Israel: and he shall have her to wife, and may not put her away all the days of his life. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>But if what he charged her with be true, and virginity be not found in the damsel: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>They shall cast her out of the doors of her father's house, and the men of the city shall stone her to death, and she shall die: because she hath done a wicked thing in Israel, to play the whore in her father's house: and thou shalt take away the evil out of the midst of thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>If a man lie with another man's wife, they shall both die, that is to say, the adulterer and the adulteress: and thou shalt take away the evil out of Israel. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>If a man have espoused a damsel that is a virgin, and some one find her in the city, and lie with her, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>Thou shalt bring them both out to the gate of that city, and they shall be stoned: the damsel, because she cried not out, being in the city: the man, because he hath humbled his neighbour's wife. And thou shalt take away the evil from the midst of thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>But if a man find a damsel that is betrothed, in the field, and taking hold of her, lie with her, he alone shall die: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>The damsel shall suffer nothing, neither is she guilty of death : for as a robber riseth against his brother, and taketh away his life, so also did the damsel suffer: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>She was alone in the field: she cried, and there was no man to help her. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, who is not espoused, and taking her, lie with her, and the matter come to judgment : 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>He that lay with her shall give to the father of the maid fifty sides of silver, and shall have her to wife, because he hath humbled her: he may not put her away all the days of his life. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>No man shall take his father's wife, nor remove his covering. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
