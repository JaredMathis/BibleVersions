<h3>Chapter 1 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the will of God, to all the saints who are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>Grace be to you, and peace from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>Blessed by the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with spiritual blessings in heavenly places, in Christ: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>As he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and unspotted in his sight in charity. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>Who hath predestinated us unto the adoption of children through Jesus Christ unto himself: according to the purpose of his will: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>Unto the praise of the glory of his grace, in which he hath graced us in his beloved son. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>In whom we have redemption through his blood, the remission of sins, according to the riches of his grace, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>Which hath superabounded in us in all wisdom and prudence, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>That he might make known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure, which he hath purposed in him, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>In the dispensation of the fulness of times, to re-establish all things in Christ, that are in heaven and on earth, in him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>In whom we also are called by lot, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things according to the counsel of his will. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>That we may be unto the praise of his glory, we who before hoped Christ: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>In whom you also, after you had heard the word of truth, (the gospel of your salvation;) in whom also believing, you were signed with the holy Spirit of promise, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>Who is the pledge of our inheritance, unto the redemption of acquisition, unto the praise of his glory. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>Wherefore I also, hearing of your faith that is in the Lord Jesus, and of your love towards all the saints, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>Cease not to give thanks for you, making commemoration of you in my prayers, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and of revelation, in the knowledge of him: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>The eyes of your heart enlightened, that you may know what the hope is of the glory of his inheritance in the saints. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>And what is the exceeding greatness of his power towards us, who believe according to the operation of the might of his power, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>Which he wrought in Christ, raising him up from the dead, and setting him on his right hand in the heavenly places. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>Above all principality, and power, and virtue, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>And he hath subjected all things under his feet, and hath made him head over all the church, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>Which is his body, and the fulness of him who is filled all in all. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
