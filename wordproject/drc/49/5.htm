<h3>Chapter 5 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>Be ye therefore followers of God, as most dear children; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath delivered himself for us, an oblation and a sacrifice to God for an odour of sweetness. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not so much as be named among you, as becometh saints: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>Or obscenity, or foolish talking, or scurrility, which is to no purpose; but rather giving of thanks. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>For know you this and understand, that no fornicator, or unclean, or covetous person (which is a serving of idols), hath inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>Let no man deceive you with vain words. For because of these things cometh the anger of God upon the children of unbelief. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>Be ye not therefore partakers with them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>For you were heretofore darkness, but now light in the Lord. Walk then as children of the light. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>For the fruit of the light is in all goodness, and justice, and truth; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>Proving what is well pleasing to God: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>For the things that are done by them in secret, it is a shame even to speak of. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>But all things that are reproved, are made manifest by the light; for all that is made manifest is light. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>Wherefore he saith: Rise thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead: and Christ shall enlighten thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>See therefore, brethren, how you walk circumspectly: not as unwise, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>But as wise: redeeming the time, because the days are evil. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>Wherefore become not unwise, but understanding what is the will of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>And be not drunk with wine, wherein is luxury; but be ye filled with the holy Spirit, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>Speaking to yourselves in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual canticles, singing and making melody in your hearts to the Lord; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>Giving thanks always for all things, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to God and the Father: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>Being subject one to another, in the fear of Christ. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>Let women be subject to their husbands, as to the Lord: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>Because the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ is the head of the church. He is the saviour of his body. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>Therefore as the church is subject to Christ, so also let the wives be to their husbands in all things. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>Husbands, love your wives, as Christ also loved the church, and delivered himself up for it: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>That he might sanctify it, cleansing it by the laver of water in the word of life: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any; such thing; but that it should be holy, and without blemish. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>So also ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife, loveth himself. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>For no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, as also Christ doth the church: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>Because we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and they shall be two in one flesh. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>This is a great sacrament; but I speak in Christ and in the church. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>Nevertheless let every one of you in particular love his wife as himself: and let the wife fear her husband. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
