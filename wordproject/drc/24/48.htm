<h3>Chapter 48 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>Against Moab thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Woe to Nabo, for it is laid waste, and confounded: Cariathaim is taken: the strong city is confounded and hath trembled. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>There is no more rejoicing in Moab over Hesebon: they have devised evil. Come, and let us cut it off from being a nation. Therefore shalt thou in silence hold thy peace, and the sword shall follow thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>A voice of crying from Oronaim: waste, and great destruction. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>Moab is destroyed: proclaim a cry for her little ones. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>For by the ascent of Luith shall the mourner go up with weeping: for in the descent of Oronaim the enemies have heard a howling of destruction. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>Flee, save your lives: and be as heath in the wilderness. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>For because thou hast trusted in thy bulwarks, and in thy treasures, thou also shalt be taken: and Chamos shall go into captivity, his priests, and his princes together. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And the spoiler shall come upon every city, and no city shall escape: and the valleys shall perish, and the plains shall be destroyed, for the Lord hath spoken: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>Give a flower to Moab, for in its flower it shall go out: and the cities thereof shall be desolate, and uninhabited. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>Cursed be he that doth the work of the Lord deceitfully: and cursed be he that withholdeth his sword from blood. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>Moab hath been fruitful from his youth, and hath rested upon his lees: and hath not been poured out from vessel to vessel, nor hath gone into captivity : therefore his taste hath remained in him, and his scent is not changed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>Therefore behold the days come, saith the Lord, and I will send him men that shall order and overturn his bottles, and they shall cast him down, and shall empty his vessels, and break their bottles one against another. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And Moab shall be ashamed of Chamos, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel, in which they trusted. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>How do you say: We are valiant, and stout men in battle? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>Moab is laid waste, and they have cast down her cities: and her choice young men are gone down to the slaughter: saith the king, whose name is the Lord of hosts. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>The destruction of Moab is near to come: the calamity thereof shall come on exceeding swiftly. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>Comfort him, all you that are round about him, and all you that know his name, say: How is the strong staff broken, the beautiful rod? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>Come down from thy glory, and sit in thirst, O dwelling of the daughter of Dibon: because the spoiler of Moab is come up to thee, he hath destroyed thy bulwarks. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>Stand in the way, and look out, O habitation of Aroer: inquire of him that fleeth: and say to him that hath escaped: What Is done? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>Moab is confounded, because he is overthrown: howl ye, and cry, tell ye it in Amen, that Moab is wasted. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>And judgment is come upon the plain country: upon Helon, and upon Jasa, and upon Mephaath. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>And upon Dibon, and upon Nabo, and upon the house of Deblathaim, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>And upon Cariathaim, and upon Bethgamul, and upon Bethmaon, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>And upon Carioth, and upon Bosra: and upon all the cities of the land of Moab, far or near. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, saith the Lord. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>Make him drunk, because he lifted up himself against the Lord: and Moab shall dash his hand in his own vomit, and he also shall be in derision. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>For Israel hath been a derision unto thee: as though thou hadst found him amongst thieves: for thy words therefore, which thou hast spoken against him, thou shalt be led away captive. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>Leave the cities, and dwell in the rock, you that dwell in Moab: and be ye Iike the dove that maketh her nest in the mouth of the hole in the highest place. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>We have heard the pride of Moab, he is exceeding proud: his haughtiness, and his arrogancy, and his pride, and the loftiness of his heart. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>I know, saith the Lord, his boasting, and that the strength thereof is not according to it, neither hath it endeavoured to do according as it was able. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>Therefore will I lament for Moab, and I will cry out to all Moab, for the men of the brick wall that mourn. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>O vineyard of Sabama, I will weep for thee, with the mourning of Jazer: thy branches are gone over the sea, they are come even to the sea of Jazer: the robber hath rushed in upon thy harvest and thy vintage. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>Joy and gladness is taken away from Carmel, and from the land of Moab, and I have taken away the wine out of the presses: the treader of the grapes shall not sing the accustomed cheerful tune. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34 </span>From the cry of Hesebon even to Eleale, and to Jasa, they have uttered their voice: from Segor to Oronaim, as a heifer of three years old: the waters also of Nemrim shall be very bad. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35 </span>And I will take away from Moab, saith the Lord, him that offereth in the high places, and that sacrificeth to his gods. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36 </span>Therefore my heart shall sound for Moab like pipes: and my heart a sound like pipes for the men of the brick wall: because he hath done more than he could, therefore they have perished. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37 </span>For every head shall be bald, and every beard shall be shaven: all hands shall be tied together, and upon every back there shall be haircloth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38 </span>Upon all the housetops of Moab, and in the streets thereof general mourning: because I have broken Moab as an useless vessel, saith the Lord. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39 </span>How is it overthrown, and they have howled! How hath Moab bowed down the neck, and is confounded ! And Moab shall be a derision, and an example to all round about him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40 </span>Thus saith the Lord: Behold he shall fly as an eagle, and shall stretch forth his wings to Moab. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41 </span>Carioth is taken, and the strong holds are won: and the heart of the valiant men of Moab in that day shall be as the heart of a woman in labour. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42 </span>And Moab shall cease to be a people : because he hath gloried against the Lord. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="43">43 </span>Fear, and the pit, and the snare come upon thee, O inhabitant of Moab, saith the Lord. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="44">44 </span>He that shall flee from the fear, shall fall into the pit: and he that shall get up out of the pit, shall be taken in the snare: for I will bring upon Moab the year of their visitation, saith the Lord. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="45">45 </span>They that fled from the snare stood in the shadow of Hesebon: but there came a fire out of Kesebon, and a flame out of the midst of Seen, and it shall devour part of Moab. and the crown of the head of the children of tumult. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="46">46 </span>Woe to thee, Moab, thou hast perished, O people of Chamos: for thy sons, and thy daughters are taken captives. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="47">47 </span>And I will bring back the captivity of Moab in the last days, saith the Lord. Hitherto the judgments of Moab. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
