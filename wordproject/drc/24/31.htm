<h3>Chapter 31 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>At that time, saith the Lord, I will be the God of all the families of and they shall be my people. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>Thus saith the Lord: The people were left and escaped from the sword, found grace in the desert: Israel shall to his rest. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>The Lord hath appeared from afar to me. Yea I have loved thee with everlasting love, therefore have I drawn thee, taking pity on thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And I will build thee again, and thou shalt be built, 0 virgin of Israel: thou shalt again be adorned with thy timbrels, and shalt go forth in the dances of them that make merry. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>Thou shalt yet plant vineyards in the mountains of Samaria: the planters shall plant, and they shall not gather the vintage before the time. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>For there shall be a day, in which the watchmen on mount Ephraim, shall cry: Arise, and let us go up to Sion to the Lord our God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>For thus saith the Lord: Rejoice ye in the joy of Jacob, and neigh before the head of the Gentiles: shout ye, and sing, and say: Save, O Lord, thy people, the remnant of Israel. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>Behold I will bring them from the north country, and will gather them from the ends of the earth: and among them shall be the blind, and the lame, the woman with child, and she that is bringing forth, together, a great company of them returning hither. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>They shall come with weeping: and I will bring them back in mercy: and I will bring them through the torrents of waters in a right way, and they shall not stumble in it: for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my firstborn. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>Hear the word of the Lord, O ye nations, and declare it in the islands that are afar off, and say: He that scattered Israel will gather him: and he will keep him as the shepherd doth his flock. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>For the Lord hath redeemed Jacob, and delivered him out of the hand of one that was mightier than he. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And they shall come, and shall give praise in mount Sion: and they shall flow together to the good things of the Lord, for the corn, and wine, and oil, and the increase of cattle and herds, and their soul shall be as a watered garden, and they shall be hungry no more. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, the young men and old men together: and I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them joyful after their sorrow. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>And I will fill the soul of the priests with fatness: and my people shall be filled with my good things, saith the Lord. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>Thus saith the Lord: A voice was heard on high of lamentation, of mourning, and weeping, of Rachel weeping for her children, and refusing to be comforted for them, because they are not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>Thus saith the Lord: Let thy voice cease from weeping, and thy eyes from tears: for there is a reward for thy work, saith the Lord: and they shall return out of the land of the enemy. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And here is hope for thy last end, saith the Lord: and the children shall return to their own borders. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>Hearing I heard Ephraim when he went into captivity: thou hast chastised me, and I was instructed, as a young bullock unaccustomed to the yoke. Convert me, and I shall be converted, for thou art the Lord my God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>For after thou didst convert me, I did penance: and after thou didst shew unto me, I struck my thigh: I am confounded and ashamed, because I have borne the reproach of my youth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>Surely Ephraim is an honourable son to me, surely he is a tender child: for since I spoke of him, I will still remember him. Therefore are my bowels troubled for him: pitying I will pity him, saith the Lord. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>Set thee up a watchtower, make to thee bitterness: direct thy heart into the right way, wherein thou hast walked: return, O virgin of Israel, return to these thy cities. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>How long wilt thou be dissolute in deliciousness, O wandering daughter? for the Lord hath created a new thing upon the earth: A WOMAN SHALL COMPASS A MAN. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: As yet shall they say this word in the land of Juda, and in the cities thereof, when I shall bring back their captivity: The Lord bless thee, the beauty of justice, the holy mountain. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>And Juda and all his cities shall dwell therein together: the husbandmen and they that drive the docks. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>For I have inebriated the weary soul: and I have filled every hungry soul. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>Upon this I was as it were awaked out of a sleep, and I saw, and my sleep was sweet to me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>Behold the days come, saith the Lord: and I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Juda with the seed of men, and with the seed of beasts. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>And as I have watched over them, to pluck up, and to throw down, and to scatter, and destroy, and afflict: so will I watch over them, to build up, and to plant them, saith the Lord. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>In those days they shall say no more: The fathers have eaten a sour grape, and the teeth of the children are set on edge. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>But every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man that shall eat the sour grape, his teeth shall be set on edge. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>Behold the days shall come, saith the Lord, and I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Juda: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>Not according to the covenant which I made with their fathers, in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt: the covenant which they made void, and I had dominion over them, saith the Lord. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel, after those days, saith the Lord: I will give my law in their bowels, and I will write it in their heart: and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34 </span>And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying: Know the Lord: for all shall know me from the least of them even to the greatest, saith the Lord: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35 </span>Thus saith the Lord, who giveth the sun for the light of the day, the order of the moon and of the stars, for the light of the night: who stirreth up the sea, and the waves thereof roar, the Lord of hosts is his name. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36 </span>If these ordinances shall fail before me, saith the Lord: then also the seed of Israel shall fail, so as not to be a nation before me for ever. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37 </span>Thus saith the Lord: If the heavens above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, I also will cast away all the seed of Israel, for all that they have done, saith the Lord. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38 </span>Behold the days come, saith the Lord, that the city shall be built to the Lord from the tower of Hanameel even to the gate of the corner. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39 </span>And the measuring line shall go out farther in his sight upon the hill Gareb: and it shall compass Goatha, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40 </span>And the whole valley of dead bodies and of ashes, and all the country of death, even to the torrent Cedron, and the corner of the horse gate towards the east, the Holy of the Lord: it shall not be plucked up, and it shall not be destroyed any more for ever. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
