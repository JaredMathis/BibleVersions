<h3>Chapter 49 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>Against the children of Ammon. Thus saith the Lord: Hath Israel no sons? or hath he no heir? Why then hath Melchom inherited Gad: and his people dwelt in his cities ? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>Therefore behold the days come, saith the Lord, and I will cause the noise of war to be heard in Rabbath of the children of Ammon, and it shall be destroyed into a heap, and her daughters shall be burnt with fire, and Israel shall possess them that have possessed him, saith the Lord. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>Howl, O Hesebon, for Hai is wasted. Cry, ye daughters of Rabbath, gird yourselves with haircloth: mourn and go about by the hedges: for Melchom shall be carried into captivity, his priests, and his princes together. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>Why gloriest thou in the valleys? thy valley hath flowed away, O delicate daughter, that hast trusted in thy treasures, and hast said: Who shall come to me? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>Behold I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord God of hosts, from all that are round about thee: and you shall be scattered every one out of one another's sight, neither shall there be any to gather together them that flee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>And afterwards I will cause the captives of the children of Ammon to return, saith the Lord. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>Against Edom. Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Is wisdom no more in Theman? counsel is perished from her children: their wisdom is become unprofitable. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>Flee and turn your backs, go down into the deep hole, ye inhabitants of Dedan: for I have brought the destruction of Esau upon him, the time of his visitation. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>If grapegatherers had come to thee, would they not have left a bunch? if thieves in the night, they would have taken what was enough for them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>But I have made Esau bare, I have revealed his secrets, and he cannot be hid: his seed is laid waste, and his brethren, and his neighbours, and he shall not be. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>Leave thy fatherless children: I will make them live: and thy widows shall hope in me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>For thus saith the Lord: Behold they whose judgment was not to drink of the cup, shall certainly drink: and shalt thou come off as innocent? thou shalt not come off as innocent, but drinking thou shalt drink. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>For I have sworn by myself, saith the Lord, that Bosra shall become a desolation, and a reproach, and a desert, and a curse: and all her cities shall be everlasting wastes. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>I have heard a rumour from the Lord, and an ambassador is sent to the nations: Gather yourselves together, and come against her, and let us rise up to battle. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>For behold I have made thee a little one among the nations, despicable among men. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>Thy arrogancy hath deceived thee, and the pride of thy heart: O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, and endeavourest to lay hold on the height of the hill : but though thou shouldst make thy nest as high as an eagle, I will bring thee down from thence, saith the Lord. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And Edom shall be desolate: every one that shall pass by it, shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all its plagues. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>As Sodom was overthrown and Gomorrha, and the neighbours thereof, saith the Lord: there shall not a man dwell there, and there shall no son of man inhabit it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>Behold one shall come up as a lion from the swelling of the Jordan, against the strong and beautiful: for I will make him run suddenly upon her: and who shall be the chosen one whom I may appoint over her? for who is like to m? and who shall abide me? and who is that shepherd that can withstand my countenance? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>Therefore hear ye the counsel of the Lord, which he hath taken concerning Edom: and his thoughts which he hath thought concerning the inhabitants of Theman: surely the little ones of the flock shall cast them down, of a truth they shall destroy them with their habitation. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>The earth is moved at the noise of their fall: the cry of their voice is heard in the Red Sea. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>Behold he shall come up as an eagle, and fly: and he shall spread his wings over Bosra: and in that day the heart of the valiant ones of Edom shall be as the heart of a woman in labour. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>Against Damascus. Emath is confounded and Arphad: for they have heard very bad tidings, they are troubled as in the sea: through care they could not rest. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>Damascus is undone, she is put to flight, trembling hath seized on her: anguish and sorrows have taken her as a woman in labour. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>How have they forsaken the city of renown, the city of joy ! 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets: and all the men of war shall be silent in that day, saith the Lord of hosts. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, rind it shall devour the strong holds of Benadad. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>Against Cedar and against the kingdoms of Asor, which Nabuchodonouor king of Babylon destroyed. Thus saith the Lord: Arise, and go ye up to Cedar, and waste the children of the east. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>They shall take their tents, and their flocks: and shall carry off for themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels: and they shall call fear upon them round about. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>Flee ye, get away speedily, sit in deep holes, you that inhabit Asur, saith the Lord: for Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you, and hath conceived designs against you. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>Arise, and so up to a nation that is at ease, and that dwelleth securely, saith the Lord: they have neither gates, nor bars: they dwell alone. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>And their camels shall be for a spoil, and the multitude of their cattle for a booty, and I will scatter into every wind them that have their hair cut round, and I will bring destruction upon them from I all their confines, saith the Lord. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>And Asor shall be a habitation for dragons, desolate for ever: no man shall abide there, nor son of man inhabit it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34 </span>The word of the Lord that came to Jeremias the prophet against Elam, in the beginning of the reign of Sedecias king of Juda, saying: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35 </span>Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Behold I will break the bow of Elam, and their chief strength. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36 </span>And I will bring upon Elam the four winds from the fear quarters of heaven: and I will scatter them into all these winds: and there shall be no nation, to which the fugitives of Elam shall not come. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37 </span>And I will cause Elam to be afraid before their enemies, and in the sight of them that seek their life: and I will bring evil upon them, my fierce wrath, saith the Lord : and will send the sword after them, till I consume them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38 </span>And I will set my throne in Elam, and destroy kings and princes from thence, saith the Lord. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39 </span>But in the latter days I will cause the captives of Elam, to return, saith the Lord. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
