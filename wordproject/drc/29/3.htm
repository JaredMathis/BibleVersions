<h3>Chapter 3 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>For behold in those days, and in that time when I shall bring back the captivity of Juda and Jerusalem: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>I will gather together all nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Josaphat: and I will plead with them there for my people, and for my inheritance Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations, and have parted my land. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>And they have cast lots upon my people: and the boy they have put in the stews, and the girl they have sold for wine, that they might drink. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>But what have you to do with me, O Tyre, and Sidon, and all the coast of the Philistines? will you revenge yourselves on me? and if you revenge yourselves on me, I will very soon return you a recompense upon your own head. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>For you have taken away my silver and my gold: and my desirable and most beautiful things you have carried into your temples. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>And the children of Juda, and the children of Jerusalem you have sold to the children of the Greeks, that you might remove them far off from their own country. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>Behold, I will raise them up out of the place wherein you have sold them: and I will return your recompense upon your own heads. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And I will sell your sons, and your daughters by the hands of the children of Juda, and they shall sell them to the Sabeans, a nation far off, for the Lord hath spoken it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>Proclaim ye this among the nations: prepare war, rouse up the strong: let them come, let all the men of war come up. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>Cut your ploughshares into swords, and your spades into spears. Let the weak say: I am strong. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>Break forth, and come, all ye nations, from round about, and gather yourselves together: there will the Lord cause all thy strong ones to fall down. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>Let them arise, and let the nations come up into the valley of Josaphat: for there I will sit to judge all nations round about. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>Put ye in the sickles, for the harvest is ripe: come and go down, for the press is full, the fats run over: for their wickedness is multiplied. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>Nations, nations in the valley of destruction: for the day of the Lord is near in the valley of destruction. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>The sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars have withdrawn their shining. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>And the Lord shall roar out of Sion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem: and the heavens and the earth shall be moved, and the Lord shall be the hope of his people, and the strength of the children of Israel. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And you shall know that I am the Lord your God, dwelling in Sion my holy mountain: and Jerusalem shall be holy and strangers shall pass through it no more. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall drop down sweetness, and the hills shall flow with milk: and waters shall flow through all the rivers of Juda: and a fountain shall come forth of the house of the Lord, and shall water the torrent of thorns. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom a wilderness destroyed: because they have done unjustly against the children of Juda, and have shed innocent blood in their land. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>And Judea shall be inhabited for ever, and Jerusalem to generation and generation. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>And I will cleanse their blood which I had not cleansed: and the Lord will dwell in Sion. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
