<h3>Chapter 2 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>Blow ye the trumpet in Sion, sound an alarm in my holy mountain, let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: because the day of the Lord cometh, because it is nigh at hand, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>A day of darkness, and of gloominess, a day of clouds and whirlwinds: a numerous and strong people as the morning spread upon the mountains: the like to it hath not been from the beginning, nor shall be after it even to the years of generation and generation. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>Before the face thereof a devouring fire, and behind it a burning flame: the land is like a garden of pleasure before it, and behind it a desolate wilderness, neither is there any one that can escape it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses, and they shall run like horsemen. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>They shall leap like the noise of chariots upon the tops of mountains, like the noise of a flame of fire devouring the stubble, as a strong people prepared to battle. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>At their presence the people shall be in grievous pains: all faces shall be made like a kettle. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>They shall run like valiant men: like men of war they shall scale the wall: the men shall march every one on his way, and they shall not turn aside from their ranks. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>No one shall press upon his brother: they shall walk every one in his path: yea, and they shall fall through the windows, and shall take no harm. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>They shall enter into the city: they shall run upon the wall, they shall climb up the houses, they shall come in at the windows as a thief. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>At their presence the earth hath trembled, the heavens are moved: the sun and moon are darkened, and the stars have withdrawn their shining. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And the Lord hath uttered his voice before the face of his army: for his armies are exceeding great, for they are strong and execute his word: for the day of the Lord is great and very terrible: and who can stand it? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>Now therefore saith the Lord: Be converted to me with all your heart, in fasting, and in weeping, and in mourning. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And rend your hearts, and not your garments, and turn to the Lord your God: for he is gracious and merciful, patient and rich in mercy, and ready to repent of the evil. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>Who knoweth but he will return, and forgive, and leave a blessing behind him, sacrifice and libation to the Lord your God? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>Blow the trumpet in Sion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>Gather together the people, sanctify the church, assemble the ancients, gather together the little ones, and them that suck at the breasts: let the bridegroom go forth from his bed, and the bride out of her bride chamber. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>Between the porch and the altar the priests the Lord's ministers shall weep, and shall say: Spare, O Lord, spare thy people: and give not thy inheritance to reproach, that the heathen should rule over them. Why should they say among the nations: Where is their God? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>The Lord hath been zealous for his land, and hath spared his people. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>And the Lord answered and said to his people: Behold I will send you corn, and wine, and oil, and you shall be filled with them: and I will no more make you a reproach among the nations. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>And I will remove far off from you the northern enemy: and I will drive him into a land unpassable, and desert, with his face towards the east sea, and his hinder part towards the utmost sea: and his stench shall ascend, and his rottenness shall go up, because he hath done proudly. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>Fear not, O land, be glad and rejoice: for the Lord hath done great things. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>Fear not, ye beasts of the fields: for the beautiful places of the wilderness are sprung, for the tree hath brought forth its fruit, the fig tree, and the vine have yielded their strength. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>And you, O children of Sion, rejoice, and be joyful in the Lord your God: because he hath given you a teacher of justice, and he will make the early and the latter rain to come down to you as in the beginning. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>And the floors shall be filled with wheat, and the presses shall overflow with wine and oil. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>And I will restore to you the ears which the locust, and the bruchus, and the mildew, and the palmerworm have eaten; my great host which I sent upon you. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>And you shall eat in plenty, and shall be filled: and you shall praise the name of the Lord your God, who hath done wonders with you, and my people shall not be confounded for ever. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>And you shall know that I am in the midst of Israel: and I am the Lord your God, and there is none besides: and my people shall not be confounded for ever. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>And it shall come to pass after this, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy: your old men shall dream dreams, and your young men shall see visions. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>Moreover upon my servants and handmaids in those days I will pour forth my spirit. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>And I will shew wonders in heaven; and in earth, blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood: before the great and dreadful day of the Lord doth come. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>And it shall come to pass, that every one that shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved: for in mount Sion, and in Jerusalem shall be salvation, as the Lord hath said, and in the residue whom the Lord shall call. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
