<h3>Chapter 7 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>AND there assembled together unto him the Pharisees and some of the scribes, coming from Jerusalem. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And when they had seen some of his disciples eat bread with common, that is, with unwashed hands, they found fault. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>For the Pharisees, and all the Jews eat not without often washing their hands, holding the tradition of the ancients: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And when they come from the market, unless they be washed, they eat not: and many other things there are that have been delivered to them to observe, the washings of cups and of pots, and of brazen vessels, and of beds. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>And the Pharisees and scribes asked him: Why do not thy disciples walk according to the tradition of the ancients, but they eat bread with common hands? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>But he answering, said to them: Well did Isaias prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written: This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>And in vain to they worship me, teaching doctrines and precepts of men. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>For leaving the commandment of God, you hold the tradition of men, the washing of pots and of cups: and many other things you do like to these. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>And he said to them: Well do you make void the commandment of God, that you may keep your own tradition. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>For Moses said: Honor thy father and thy mother; and He that shall curse father or mother, dying let him die. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>But you say: If a man shall say to his father or mother, Corban, (which is a gift,) whatsoever is from me, shall profit thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And further you suffer him not to do any thing for his father or mother, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>Making void the word of God by your own tradition, which you have given forth. And many other such like things you do. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>And calling again the multitude unto him, he said to them: Hear ye me all, and understand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>There is nothing from without a man that entering into him, can defile him. But the things which come from a man, those are they that defile a man. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>If any man have ears to hear, let him hear. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And when he was come into the house from the multitude, his disciples asked him the parable. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>And he saith to them: So are you also without knowledge? understand you not that every thing from without, entering into a man cannot defile him: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>Because it entereth not into his heart, but goeth into the belly, and goeth out into the privy, purging all meats? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>But he said that the things which come out from a man, they defile a man. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>For from within out of the heart of men proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>All these evil things come from within, and defile a man. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>And rising from thence he went into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon: and entering into a house, he would that no man should know it, and he could not be hid. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>For a woman as soon as she heard of him, whose daughter had an unclean spirit, came in and fell down at his feet. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>For the woman was a Gentile, a Syrophenician born. And she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>Who said to her: Suffer first the children to be filled: for it is not good to take the bread of the children, and cast it to the dogs. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>But she answered and said to him: Yea, Lord; for the whelps also eat under the table of the crumbs of the children. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>And he said to her: For this saying go thy way, the devil is gone out of thy daughter. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>And when she was come into her house, she found the girl lying upon the bed, and that the devil was gone out. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>And again going out of the coasts of Tyre, he came by Sidon to the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>And they bring to him one deaf and dumb; and they besought him that he would lay his hand upon him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>And taking him from the multitude apart, he put his fingers into his ears, and spitting, he touched his tongue: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34 </span>And looking up to heaven, he groaned, and said to him: Ephpheta, which is, Be thou opened. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35 </span>And immediately his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spoke right. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36 </span>And he charged them that they should tell no man. But the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal did they publish it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37 </span>And so much the more did they wonder, saying: He hath done all things well; he hath made both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
