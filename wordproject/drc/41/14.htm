<h3>Chapter 14 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>NOW the feast of the pasch, and of the Azymes was after two days; and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might by some wile lay hold on him, and kill him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>But they said: Not on the festival day, lest there should be a tumult among the people. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>And when he was in Bethania, in the house of Simon the leper, and was at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of precious spikenard: and breaking the alabaster box, she poured it out upon his head. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>Now there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said: Why was this waste of the ointment made? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>For this ointment might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, and given to the poor. And they murmured against her. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>But Jesus said: Let her alone, why do you molest her? She hath wrought a good work upon me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>For the poor you have always with you: and whensoever you will, you may do them good: but me you have not always. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>She hath done what she could: she is come beforehand to anoint my body for burial. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>Amen, I say to you, wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, that also which she hath done, shall be told for a memorial of her. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests, to betray him to them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>Who hearing it were glad; and they promised him they would give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>Now on the first day of the unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the pasch, the disciples say to him: Whither wilt thou that we go, and prepare for thee to eat the pasch? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And he sendeth two of his disciples, and saith to them: Go ye into the city; and there shall meet you a man carrying a pitcher of water, follow him; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>And whithersoever he shall go in, say to the master of the house, The master saith, Where is my refectory, where I may eat the pasch with my disciples? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And he will shew you a large dining room furnished; and there prepare ye for us. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>And his disciples went their way, and came into the city; and they found as he had told them, and they prepared the pasch. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And when evening was come, he cometh with the twelve. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>And when they were at table and eating, Jesus saith: Amen I say to you, one of you that eateth with me shall betray me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>But they began to be sorrowful, and to say to him one by one: Is it I? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>Who saith to them: One of the twelve, who dippeth with me his hand in the dish. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>And the Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man shall be betrayed. It were better for him, if that man had not been born. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>And whilst they were eating, Jesus took bread; and blessing, broke, and gave to them, and said: Take ye. This is my body. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>And having taken the chalice, giving thanks, he gave it to them. And they all drank of it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>And he said to them: This is my blood of the new testament, which shall be shed for many. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>Amen I say to you, that I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I shall drink it new in the kingdom of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>And when they had said an hymn, they went forth to the mount of Olives. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>And Jesus saith to them: You will all be scandalized in my regard this night; for it is written, I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep shall be dispersed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>But after I shall be risen again, I will go before you into Galilee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>But Peter saith to him: Although all shall be scandalized in thee, yet not I. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>And Jesus saith to him: Amen I say to thee, to day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shall deny me thrice. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>But he spoke the more vehemently: Although I should die together with thee, I will not deny thee. And in like manner also said they all. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>And they came to a farm called Gethsemani. And he saith to his disciples: Sit you here, while I pray. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>And he taketh Peter and James and John with him; and he began to fear and to be heavy. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34 </span>And he saith to them: My soul is sorrowful even unto death; stay you here, and watch. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35 </span>And when he was gone forward a little, he fell flat on the ground; and he prayed, that if it might be, the hour might pass from him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36 </span>And he saith: Abba, Father, all things are possible to thee: remove this chalice from me; but not what I will, but what thou wilt. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37 </span>And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping. And he saith to Peter: Simon, sleepest thou? couldst thou not watch one hour? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38 </span>Watch ye, and pray that you enter not into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39 </span>A going away again, he prayed, saying the same words. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40 </span>And when he returned, he found them again asleep, (for their eyes were heavy,) and they knew not what to answer him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41 </span>And he cometh the third time, and saith to them: Sleep ye now, and take your rest. It is enough: the hour is come: behold the Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of sinners. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42 </span>Rise up, let us go. Behold, he that will betray me is at hand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="43">43 </span>And while he was yet speaking, cometh Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve: and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the ancients. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="44">44 </span>And he that betrayed him, had given them a sign, saying: Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he; lay hold on him, and lead him away carefully. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="45">45 </span>And when he was come, immediately going up to him, he saith: Hail, Rabbi; and he kissed him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="46">46 </span>But they laid hands on him, and held him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="47">47 </span>An one of them that stood by, drawing a sword, struck a servant of the chief priest, and cut off his ear. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="48">48 </span>And Jesus answering, said to them: Are you come out as to a robber, with swords and staves to apprehend me? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="49">49 </span>I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and you did not lay hands on me. But that the scriptures may be fulfilled. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="50">50 </span>Then his disciples leaving him, all fled away. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="51">51 </span>And a certain young man followed him, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; and they laid hold on him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="52">52 </span>But he, casting off the linen cloth, fled from them naked. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="53">53 </span>And they brought Jesus to the high priest; and all the priests and the scribes and the ancients assembled together. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="54">54 </span>And Peter followed him from afar off, even into the court of the high priest; and he sat with the servants at the fire, and warmed himself. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="55">55 </span>And the chief priests and all the council sought for evidence against Jesus, that they might put him to death, and found none. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="56">56 </span>For many bore false witness against him, and their evidences were not agreeing. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="57">57 </span>And some rising up, bore false witness against him, saying: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="58">58 </span>We heard him say, I will destroy this temple made with hands, and within three days I will build another not made with hands. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="59">59 </span>And their witness did not agree. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="60">60 </span>And the high priest rising up in the midst, asked Jesus, saying: Answerest thou nothing to the things that are laid to thy charge by these men? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="61">61 </span>But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said to him: Art thou the Christ the Son of the blessed God? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="62">62 </span>And Jesus said to him: I am. And you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of the power of God, and coming with the clouds of heaven. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="63">63 </span>Then the high priest rending his garments, saith: What need we any further witnesses? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="64">64 </span>You have heard the blasphemy. What think you? Who all condemned him to be guilty of death. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="65">65 </span>And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him: Prophesy: and the servants struck him with the palms of their hands. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="66">66 </span>Now when Peter was in the court below, there cometh one of the maidservants of the high priest. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="67">67 </span>And when she had seen Peter warming himself, looking on him she saith: Thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="68">68 </span>But he denied, saying: I neither know nor understand what thou sayest. And he went forth before the court; and the cock crew. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="69">69 </span>And again a maidservant seeing him, began to say to the standers by: This is one of them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="70">70 </span>But he denied again. And after a while they that stood by said again to Peter: Surely thou art one of them; for thou art also a Galilean. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="71">71 </span>But he began to curse and to swear, saying; I know not this man of whom you speak. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="72">72 </span>And immediately the cock crew again. And Peter remembered the word that Jesus had said unto him: Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt thrice deny me. And he began to weep. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
