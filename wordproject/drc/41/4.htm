<h3>Chapter 4 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>AND again he began to teach by the sea side; and a great multitude was gathered together unto him, so that he went up into a ship, and sat in the sea; and all the multitude was upon the land by the sea side. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And he taught them many things in parables, and said unto them in his doctrine: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>Hear ye: Behold, the sower went out to sow. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And whilst he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the birds of the air came and ate it up. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>And other some fell upon stony ground, where it had not much earth; and it shot up immediately, because it had no depth of earth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>And when the sun was risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>And some fell among thorns; and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And some fell upon good ground; and brought forth fruit that grew up, and increased and yielded, one thirty, another sixty, and another a hundred. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>And he said: He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>And when he was alone, the twelve that were with him asked him the parable. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And he said to them: To you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but to them that are without, all things are done in parables: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand: lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And he saith to them: Are you ignorant of this parable? and how shall you know all parables? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>He that soweth, soweth the word. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown, and as soon as they have heard, immediately Satan cometh and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>And these likewise are they that are sown on the stony ground: who when they have heard the word, immediately recieve it with joy. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And they have no root in themselves, but are only for a time: and then when tribulation and persecution ariseth for the word they are presently scandalized. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>And others there are who are sown among thorns: these are they that hear the word, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>And the cares of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts after other things entering in choke the word, and it is made fruitless. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>And these are they who are sown upon the good ground, who hear the word, and receive it, and yield fruit, the one thirty, another sixty, and another a hundred. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>And he said to them: Doth a candle come in to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>For there is nothing hid, which shall not be made manifest: neither was it made secret, but that it may come abroad. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>If any man have ears to hear, let him hear. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>And he said to them: Take heed what you hear. In what measure you shall mete, it shall be measured to you again, and more shall be given to you. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, that also which he hath shall be taken away from him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>And he said: So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the earth, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>And should sleep, and rise, night and day, and the seed should spring, and grow up whilst he knoweth not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>For the earth of itself bringeth forth fruit, first the blade, then the ear, afterwards the full corn in the ear. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>And when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>And he said: To what shall we liken the kingdom of God? or to what parable shall we compare it? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>It is as a grain of mustard seed: which when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that are in the earth: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>And when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches, so that the birds of the air may dwell under the shadow thereof. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>And with many such parables, he spoke to them the word, according as they were able to hear. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34 </span>And without parable he did not speak unto them; but apart, he explained all things to his disciples. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35 </span>And he saith to them that day, when evening was come: Let us pass over to the other side. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36 </span>And sending away the multitude, they take him even as he was in the ship: and there were other ships with him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37 </span>And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that the ship was filled. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38 </span>And he was in the hinder part of the ship, sleeping upon a pillow; and they awake him, and say to him: Master, doth it not concern thee that we perish? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39 </span>And rising up, he rebuked the wind, and said to the sea: Peace, be still. And the wind ceased: and there was made a great calm. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40 </span>And he said to them: Why are you fearful? have you not faith yet? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41 </span>And they feared exceedingly: and they said one to another: Who is this (thinkest thou) that both wind and sea obey him? </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
