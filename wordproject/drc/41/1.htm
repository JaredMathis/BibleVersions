<h3>Chapter 1 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>THE beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>As it is written in Isaias the prophet: Behold I send my angel before thy face, who shall prepare the way before thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>A voice of one crying in the desert: Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight his paths. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>John was in the desert baptizing, and preaching the baptism of penance, unto remission of sins. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>And there went out to him all the country of Judea, and all they of Jerusalem, and were baptized by him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>And John was clothed with camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and he ate locusts and wild honey. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>And he preached, saying: There cometh after me one mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and loose. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>I have baptized you with water; but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>And it came to pass, in those days, Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>And forthwith coming up out of he water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit as a dove descending, and remaining on him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And there came a voice from heaven: Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And immediately the Spirit drove him out into the desert. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And he was in the desert forty days and forty nights, and was tempted by Satan; and he was with beasts, and the angels ministered to him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>And after that John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And saying: The time is accomplished, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent, and believe the gospel. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>And passing by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother, casting nets into the sea (for they were fishermen). 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And Jesus said to them: Come after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>And immediately leaving their nets, they followed him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>And going on from thence a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were mending their nets in the ship: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>And forthwith he called them. And leaving their father Zebedee in the ship with his hired men, they followed him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>And they entered into Capharnaum, and forthwith upon the sabbath days going into the synagogue, he taught them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>And they were astonished at his doctrine. For he was teaching them as one having power, and not as the scribes. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>Saying: What have we to do with thee, Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know who thou art, the Holy One of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>And Jesus threatened him, saying: Speak no more, and go out of the man. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>And the unclean spirit tearing him, and crying out with a loud voice, went out of him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying: What thing is this? what is this new doctrine? for with power he commandeth even the unclean spirits, and they obey him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>And the fame of him was spread forthwith into all the country of Galilee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>And immediately going out of the synagogue they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>And Simon's wife's mother lay in a fit of a fever: and forthwith they tell him of her. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>And coming to her, he lifted her up, taking her by the hand; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>And when it was evening, after sunset, they brought to him all that were ill and that were possessed with devils. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>And all the city was gathered together at the door. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34 </span>And he healed many that were troubled with divers diseases; and he cast out many devils, and he suffered them not to speak, because they knew him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35 </span>And rising very early, going out, he went into a desert place: and there he prayed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36 </span>And Simon, and they that were with him, followed after him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37 </span>And when they had found him, they said to him: All seek for thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38 </span>And he saith to them: Let us go into the neighbouring towns and cities, that I may preach there also; for to this purpose am I come. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39 </span>And he was preaching in their synagogues, and in all Galilee, and casting out devils. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40 </span>And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down said to him: If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41 </span>And Jesus having compassion on him, stretched forth his hand; and touching him, saith to him: I will. Be thou made clean. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42 </span>And when he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="43">43 </span>And he strictly charged him, and forthwith sent him away. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="44">44 </span>And he saith to him: See thou tell no one; but go, shew thyself to the high priest, and offer for thy cleansing the things that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="45">45 </span>But he being gone out, began to publish and to blaze abroad the word: so that he could not openly go into the city, but was without in desert places: and they flocked to him from all sides. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
