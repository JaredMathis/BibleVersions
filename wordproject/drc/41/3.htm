<h3>Chapter 3 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>AND he entered again into the synagogue, and there was a man there who had a withered hand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And they watched him whether he would heal on the sabbath days; that they might accuse him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>And he said to the man who had the withered hand: Stand up in the midst. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And he saith to them: Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy? But they held their peace. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>And looking round about on them with anger, being grieved for the blindness of their hearts, he saith to the man: Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched it forth: and his hand was restored unto him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>And the Pharisees going out, immediately made a consultation with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>But Jesus retired with his disciples to the sea; and a great multitude followed him from Galilee and Judea, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and from beyond the Jordan. And they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, hearing the things which he did, came to him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>And he spoke to his disciples that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>For he healed many, so that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had evils. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And the unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him: and they cried, saying: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>Thou art the Son of God. And he strictly charged them that they should not make him known. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And going up into a mountain, he called unto him whom he would himself: and they came to him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>And he made that twelve should be with him, and that he might send them to preach. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And he gave them power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>And to Simon he gave the name Peter: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he named them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>And Andrew and Philip, and Bartholomew and Matthew, and Thomas and James of Alpheus, and Thaddeus, and Simon the Cananean: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>And Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>And they come to a house, and the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>And when his friends had heard of it, they went out to lay hold on him. For they said: He is become mad. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>And the scribes who were come down from Jerusalem, said: He hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of devils he casteth out devils. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>And after he had called them together, he said to them in parables: How can Satan cast out Satan? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>And if Satan be risen up against himself, he is divided, and cannot stand, but hath an end. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>No man can enter into the house of a strong man and rob him of his goods, unless he first bind the strong man, and then shall he plunder his house. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>Amen I say to you, that all sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and the blasphemies wherewith they shall blaspheme: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost, shall never have forgiveness, but shall be guilty of an everlasting sin. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>Because they said: He hath an unclean spirit. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>And his mother and his bretheren came; and standing without, sent unto him, calling him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>And the multitude sat about him; and they say to him: Behold thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>And answering them, he said: Who is my mother and my brethren? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34 </span>And looking round about on them who sat about him, he saith: Behold my mother and my brethren. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35 </span>For whosoever shall do the will of God, he is my brother, and my sister, and mother. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
