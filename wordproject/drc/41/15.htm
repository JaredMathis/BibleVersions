<h3>Chapter 15 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>AND straightway in the morning, the chief priests holding a consultation with the ancients and the scribes and the whole council, binding Jesus, led him away, and delivered him to Pilate. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And Pilate asked him: Art thou the king of the Jews? But he answering, saith to him: Thou sayest it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>And the chief priests accused him in many things. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And Pilate again asked him, saying: Answerest thou nothing? behold in how many things they accuse thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>But Jesus still answered nothing; so that Pilate wondered. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>Now on the festival day he was wont to release unto them one of the prisoners, whomsoever they demanded. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>And there was one called Barabbas, who was put in prison with some seditious men, who in the sedition had committed murder. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And when the multitude was come up, they began to desire that he would do, as he had ever done unto them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>And Pilate answered them, and said: Will you that I release to you the king of the Jews? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him up out of envy. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas to them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And Pilate again answering, saith to them: What will you then that I do to the king of the Jews? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>But they again cried out: Crucify him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>And Pilate saith to them: Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more: Crucify him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And so Pilate being willing to satisfy the people, released to them Barabbas, and delivered up Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>And the soldiers led him away into the court of the palace, and they called together the whole band: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And they clothe him with purple, and platting a crown of thorns, they put it upon him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>And they began to salute him: Hail, king of the Jews. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>And they struck his head with a reed: and they did spit on him. And bowing their knees, they adored him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>And after they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own garments on him, and they led him out to crucify him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>And they forced one Simon a Cyrenian who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and of Rufus, to take up his cross. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>And they bring him into the place called Golgotha, which being interpreted is, The place of Calvary. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh; but he took it not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>And crucifying him, they divided his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>And it was the third hour, and they crucified him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>And the inscription of his cause was written over: THE KING OF THE JEWS. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith: And with the wicked he was reputed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>And they that passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads, and saying: Vah, thou that destroyest the temple of God, and in three days buildest it up again; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>Save thyself, coming down from the cross. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>In like manner also the chief priests mocking, said with the scribes one to another: He saved others; himself he cannot save. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>Let Christ the king of Israel come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole earth until the ninth hour. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34 </span>And at the ninth hour, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying: Eloi, Eloi, lamma sabacthani? Which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35 </span>And some of the standers by hearing, said: Behold he calleth Elias. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36 </span>And one running and filling a sponge with vinegar, and putting it upon a reed, gave him to drink, saying: Stay, let us see if Elias come to take him down. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37 </span>And Jesus having cried out with a loud voice, gave up the ghost. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38 </span>And the veil of the temple was rent in two, from the top to the bottom. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39 </span>And the centurion who stood over against him, seeing that crying out in this manner he had given up the ghost, said: Indeed this man was the son of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40 </span>And there were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalen, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joseph, and Salome: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41 </span>Who also when he was in Galilee followed him, and ministered to him, and many other women that came up with him to Jerusalem. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42 </span>And when evening was now come, (because it was the Parasceve, that is, the day before the sabbath,) 
<br /><span class="verse" id="43">43 </span>Joseph of Arimathea, a noble counsellor, who was also himself looking for the kingdom of God, came and went in boldly to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="44">44 </span>But Pilate wondered that he should be already dead. And sending for the centurion, he asked him if he were already dead. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="45">45 </span>And when he had understood it by the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="46">46 </span>And Joseph buying fine linen, and taking him down, wrapped him up in the fine linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewed out of a rock. And he rolled a stone to the door of the sepulchre. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="47">47 </span>And Mary Magdalen, and Mary the mother of Joseph, beheld where he was laid. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
