<h3>Chapter 3 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>Woe to the provoking, and redeemed city, the dove. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>She hath not hearkened to the voice, neither hath she received discipline: she hath not trusted in the Lord, she drew not near to her God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>Her princes are in the midst of her as roaring lions: her judges are evening wolves, they left nothing for the morning. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>Her prophets are senseless men without faith: her priests have polluted the sanctuary, they have acted unjustly against the law. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>The just Lord is in the midst thereof, he will not do iniquity: in the morning, in the morning he will bring his judgment to light, and it shall not be hid: but the wicked man hath not known shame. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>I have destroyed the nations, and their towers are beaten down: I have made their ways desert, so that there is none that passeth by: their cities are desolate, there is not a man remaining, nor any inhabitant. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>I said: Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive correction: and her dwelling shall not perish, for all things wherein I have visited her: but they rose early and corrupted all their thoughts. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>Wherefore expect me, saith the Lord, in the day of my resurrection that is to come, for my judgment is to assemble the Gentiles, and to gather the kingdoms: and to pour upon them my indignation, all my fierce anger: for with the fire of my jealousy shall all the earth be devoured. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>Because then I will restore to the people a chosen lip, that all may call upon the name of the Lord, and may serve him with one shoulder. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia, shall my suppliants the children of my dispersed people bring me an offering. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>In that day thou shalt not be ashamed for all thy doings, wherein thou hast transgressed against me: for then I will take away out of the midst of thee thy proud boasters, and thou shalt no more be lifted up because of my holy mountain. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And I will leave in the midst of thee a poor and needy people: and they shall hope in the name of the Lord. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies, nor shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth: for they shall feed, and shall lie down, and there shall be none to make them afraid. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>Give praise, O daughter of Sion: shout, O Israel: be glad, and rejoice with all thy heart, O daughter of Jerusalem. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>The Lord hath taken away thy judgment, he hath turned away thy enemies: the king of Israel the Lord is in the midst of thee, thou shalt fear evil no more. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem: Fear not: to Sion: Let not thy hands be weakened. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>The Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty, he will save: he will rejoice over thee with gladness, he will be silent in his love, he will be joyful over thee in praise. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>The triflers that were departed from the law, I will gather together, because they were of thee: that thou mayest no more suffer reproach for them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>Behold I will cut off all that have afflicted thee at that time: and I will save her that halteth, and will gather her that was cast out: and I will get them praise, and a name, in all the land where they had been put to confusion. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>At that time, when I will bring you: and at the time that I will gather you: for I will give you a name, and praise among all the people of the earth, when I shall have brought back your captivity before your eyes, saith the Lord. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
