<br /><span class="verse" id="52">52 </span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="53">53 </span>To these shall the land be divided for their possessions according to the number of names. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="54">54 </span>To the greater number thou shalt give a greater portion, and to the fewer a less: to every one, as they have now been reckoned up, shall a possession be delivered : 
<br /><span class="verse" id="55">55 </span>Yet so that by lot the land be divided to the tribe and families. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="56">56 </span>Whatsoever shall fall by lot, that shall be taken by the more, or the fewer. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="57">57 </span>This also is the number of the sons of Levi by their families: Gerson, of whom is the family of the Gersonites: Caath, of whom is the family of the Caathites: Merari, of whom is the family of the Merarites.

<br /><span class="verse" id="61">61 </span>Of whom Nadab and Abiu died, when they had offered the strange fire before the Lord. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="62">62 </span>And all that were numbered, were twenty-three thousand males from one month old and upward: for they were not reckoned up among the children of Israel, neither was a possession given to them with the rest. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="63">63 </span>This is the number of the children of Israel, that were enrolled by Moses and Eleazar the priest, in the plains of Moab upon the Jordan, over against Jericho. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="64">64 </span>Among whom there was not one of them that were numbered before by Moses and Aaron in the desert of Sinai. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="65">65 </span>For the Lord had foretold that they should die in the wilderness. And none remained of them, but Caleb the son of Jephone, and Josue the son of Nun. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
