<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>These are the mansions of the children of Israel, who went out of Egypt by their troops under the conduct of Moses and Aaron, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>Which Moses wrote down according to the places of their encamping, which they changed by the commandment of the Lord. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>Now the children of Israel departed from Ramesses the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month, the day after the phase, with a mighty hand, in the eight of all the Egyptians, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>Who were burying their firstborn, whom the Lord had slain (upon their gods also he had executed vengeance,) 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>And they camped in Soccoth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>And from Soccoth they came into Etham, which is in the uttermost borders of the wilderness. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>Departing from thence they came over against Phihahiroth, which looketh towards Beelsephon, and they camped before Magdalum. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And departing from Phihahiroth, they passed through the midst of the sea into the wilderness: and having marched three days through the desert of Etham, they camped in Mara. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>And departing from Mara, they came into Elim, where there were twelve fountains of waters, and seventy palm trees: and there they camped. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>But departing from thence also, they pitched their tents by the Red Sea. And departing from the Red Sea, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>They camped in the desert of Sin. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And they removed from thence, and came to Daphca. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And departing from Daphca, they camped in Alus. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>And departing from Alus, they pitched their tents in Raphidim, where the people wanted water to drink. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And departing from Raphidim, they camped in the desert of Sinai. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>But departing also from the desert of Sinai, they came to the graves of lust. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And departing from the graves of lust, they camped in Haseroth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>And from Haseroth they came to Rethma. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>And departing from Rethma, they camped in Remmomphares. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>And they departed from thence and came to Lebna. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>Removing from Lebna they camped in Ressa. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>And departing from Ressa, they came to Ceelatha. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>And they removed from thence and camped in the mountain Sepher. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>Departing from the mountain Sepher, they came to Arada. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>From thence they went and camped in Maceloth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>And departing from Maceloth, they came to Thahath. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>Removing from Thahath they camped in Thare. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>And they departed from thence, and pitched their tents in Methca. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>And removing from Methca, they camped in Hesmona. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>And departing from Hesmona, they came to Moseroth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>And removing from Moseroth, they camped in Benejaacan. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>And departing from Benejaacan, they came to mount Gadgad. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>From thence they went and camped in Jetebatha. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34 </span>And from Jetebatha they came to Hebrona. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35 </span>And departing from Hebrona, they camped in Asiongaber. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36 </span>They removed from thence and came into the desert of Sin, which is Cades. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37 </span>And departing from Cades, they camped in mount Her, in the uttermost borders of the land of Edom. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38 </span>And Aaron the priest went up into mount Hor at the commandment of the Lord: and there he died in the fortieth year of the coming forth of the children of Israel out of Egypt, W the fifth month, the first day of the month, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39 </span>When he was a hundred and twenty-three years old. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40 </span>And king Arad the Chanaanite, who dwelt towards the south, heard that the children of Israel were come to the land of Chanaan. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41 </span>And they departed from mount Her, and camped in Salmona. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42 </span>From whence they removed and came to Phunon. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="43">43 </span>And departing from Phunon, they camped in Oboth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="44">44 </span>And from Oboth they came to Ijeabarim, which is in the borders of the Moabites. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="45">45 </span>And departing from Ijeabarim they pitched their tents in Dibongab. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="46">46 </span>From thence they went and camped in Helmondeblathaim. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="47">47 </span>And departing from Helmondeblathaim, they came to the mountains of Abarim over against Nabo. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="48">48 </span>And departing from the mountains of Abarim, they passed to the plains of Moab, by the Jordan, over against Jericho. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="49">49 </span>And there they camped from Bethsi moth even to Ablesatim in the plains of the Moabites, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="50">50 </span>Where the Lord said to Moses: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="51">51 </span>Command the children of Israel, and say to them: When you shall have passed over the Jordan, entering into the land of Chanaan, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="52">52 </span>Destroy all the inhabitants of that land: beat down their pillars, and break in pieces their statues, and waste all their high places, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="53">53 </span>Cleansing the land, and dwelling in it. For I have given it you for a possession. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="54">54 </span>And you shall divide it among you by lot. To the more you shall give a larger part, and to the fewer a lesser. To every one as the lot shall fall, so shall the inheritance be given. The possession shall be divided by the tribes and the families. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="55">55 </span>But if you will not kill the inhabitants of the land: they that remain, shall be unto you as nails in your eyes, and spears in your sides, and they shall be your adversaries in the land of your habitation. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="56">56 </span>And whatsoever I had thought to do to them, I will do to you. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
