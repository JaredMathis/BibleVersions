<h3>Chapter 11 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>BE ye followers of me, as I also am of Christ. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>Now I praise you, brethren, that in all things you are mindful of me: and keep my ordinances as I have delivered them to you. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>Every man praying or prophesying with his head covered, disgraceth his head. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>But every woman praying or prophesying with her head not covered, disgraceth her head: for it is all one as if she were shaven. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>For if a woman be not covered, let her be shorn. But if it be a shame to a woman to be shorn or made bald, let her cover her head. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>The man indeed ought not to cover his head, because he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of the man. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>For the man is not of the woman, but the woman of the man. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>For the man was not created for the woman, but the woman for the man. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>Therefore ought the woman to have a power over her head, because of the angels. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>But yet neither is the man without the woman, nor the woman without the man, in the Lord. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>For as the woman is of the man, so also is the man by the woman: but all things of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>You yourselves judge: doth it become a woman, to pray unto God uncovered? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>Doth not even nature itself teach you, that a man indeed, if he nourish his hair, it is a shame unto him? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>But if a woman nourish her hair, it is a glory to her; for her hair is given to her for a covering. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor the church of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>Now this I ordain: not praising you, that you come together not for the better, but for the worse. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>For first of all I hear that when you come together in the church, there are schisms among you; and in part I believe it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>For there must be also heresies: that they also, who are approved, may be made manifest among you. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>When you come therefore together into one place, it is not now to eat the Lord's supper. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>For every one taketh before his own supper to eat. And one indeed is hungry and another is drunk. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>What, have you not houses to eat and to drink in? Or despise ye the church of God; and put them to shame that have not ? What shall I say to you? Do I praise you? In this I praise you not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>And giving thanks, broke, and said: Take ye, and eat: this is my body, which shall be delivered for you: this do for the commemoration of me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>In like manner also the chalice, after he had supped, saying: This chalice is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as often as you shall drink, for the commemoration of me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>For as often as you shall eat this bread, and drink the chalice, you shall shew the death of the Lord, until he come. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>Therefore whosoever shall eat this bread, or drink the chalice of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and of the blood of the Lord. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>But let a man prove himself: and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of the chalice. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh judgment to himself, not discerning the body of the Lord. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>Therefore are there many inform and weak among you, and many sleep. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>But if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>But whilst we are judged, we are chastised by the Lord, that we be not condemned with this world. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>Wherefore, my brethren, when you come together to eat, wait for one another. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34 </span>If any man be hungry, let him eat at home; that you come not together unto judgment. And the rest I will set in order, when I come. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
