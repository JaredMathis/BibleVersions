<h3>Chapter 10 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>FOR I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And all in Moses were baptized, in the cloud, and in the sea: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>And did all eat the same spiritual food, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And all drank the same spiritual drink; (and they drank of the spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was Christ.) 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>But with most of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the desert. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>Now these things were done in a figure of us, that we should not covet evil things as they also coveted. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>Neither become ye idolaters, as some of them, as it is written: The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed fornication, and there fell in one day three and twenty thousand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>Neither let us tempt Christ: as some of them tempted, and perished by the serpents. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>Neither do you murmur: as some of them murmured, and were destroyed by the destroyer. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>Now all these things happened to them in figure: and they are written for our correction, upon whom the ends of the world are come. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>Wherefore he that thinketh himself to stand, let him take heed lest he fall. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>Let no temptation take hold on you, but such as is human. And God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that which you are able: but will make also with temptation issue, that you may be able to bear it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>Wherefore, my dearly beloved, fly from the service of idols. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>I speak as to wise men: judge ye yourselves what I say. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>The chalice of benediction, which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ ? And the bread, which we break, is it not the partaking of the body of the Lord ? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>For we, being many, are one bread, one body, all that partake of one bread. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>Behold Israel according to the flesh: are not they, that eat of the sacrifices, partakers of the altar ? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>What then ? Do I say, that what is offered in sacrifice to idols, is any thing ? Or, that the idol is any thing ? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>But the things which the heathens sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God. And I would not that you should be made partakers with devils. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>You cannot drink the chalice of the Lord, and the chalice of devils: you cannot be partakers of the table of the Lord, and of the table of devils. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy ? Are we stronger than he? All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>All things are lawful for me, but all things do not edify. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>Let no man seek his own, but that which is another's. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, eat; asking no question for conscience' sake. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>The earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>If any of them that believe not, invite you, and you will be willing to go; eat of any thing that is set before you, asking no question for conscience' sake. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>But if any man say: This has been sacrificed to idols, do not eat of it for his sake that told it, and for conscience' sake. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>Conscience, I say, not thy own, but the other's. For why is my liberty judged by another man's conscience ? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>If I partake with thanksgiving, why am I evil spoken of, for that for which I give thanks ? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or whatsoever else you do, do all to the glory of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>Be without offence to the Jews, and to the Gentiles, and to the church of God: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>As I also in all things please all men, not seeking that which is profitable to myself, but to many, that may be saved. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
