<h3>Chapter 14 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>FOLLOW after charity, be zealous for spiritual gifts; but rather that you may prophesy. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>For he that speaketh in a tongue, speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man heareth. Yet by the Spirit he speaketh mysteries. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>But he that prophesieth, speaketh to men unto edification, and exhortation, and comfort. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>He that speaketh in a tongue, edifieth himself: but he that prophesieth, edifieth the church. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>And I would have you all to speak with tongues, but rather to prophesy. For greater is he that prophesieth, than he that speaketh with tongues: unless perhaps he interpret, that the church may receive edification. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>But now, brethren, if I come to you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I speak to you either in revelation, or in knowledge, or in prophecy, or in doctrine? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>Even things without life that give sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction of sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped ? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle ? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>So likewise you, except you utter by the tongue plain speech, how shall it be known what is said ? For you shall be speaking into the air. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>There are, for example, so many kinds of tongues in this world; and none is without voice. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>If then I know not the power of the voice, I shall be to him to whom I speak a barbarian; and he that speaketh, a barbarian to me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>So you also, forasmuch as you are zealous of spirits, seek to abound unto the edifying of the church. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And therefore he that speaketh by a tongue, let him pray that he may interpret. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is without fruit. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>What is it then ? I will pray with the spirit, I will pray also with the understanding; I will sing with the spirit, I will sing also with the understanding. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>Else if thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that holdeth the place of the unlearned say, Amen, to thy blessing ? because he knoweth not what thou sayest. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>For thou indeed givest thanks well, but the other is not edified. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>I thank my God I speak with all your tongues. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>But in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that I may instruct others also; than ten thousand words in a tongue. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>Brethren, do not become children in sense: but in malice be children, and in sense be perfect. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>In the law it is written: In other tongues and other lips I will speak to this people; and neither so will they hear me, saith the Lord. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to believers, but to unbelievers; but prophecies not to unbelievers, but to believers. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>If therefore the whole church come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in unlearned persons or infidels, will they not say that you are mad ? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or an unlearned person, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>The secrets of his heart are made manifest; and so, falling down on his face, he will adore God, affirming that God is among you indeed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>How is it then, brethren ? When you come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a revelation, hath a tongue, hath an interpretation: let all things be done to edification. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>If any speak with a tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and in course, and let one interpret. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>But if there be no interpreter, let him hold his peace in the church, and speak to himself and to God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>And let the prophets speak, two or three; and let the rest judge. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>But if any thing be revealed to another sitting, let the first hold his peace. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>For you may all prophesy one by one; that all may learn, and all may be exhorted: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>For God is not the God of dissension, but of peace: as also I teach in all the churches of the saints. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34 </span>Let women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted them to speak, but to be subject, as also the law saith. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35 </span>But if they would learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is a shame for a woman to speak in the church. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36 </span>Or did the word of God come out from you ? Or came it only unto you ? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37 </span>If any seem to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him know the things that I write to you, that they are the commandments of the Lord. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38 </span>But if any man know not, he shall not be known. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39 </span>Wherefore, brethren, be zealous to prophesy; and forbid not to speak with tongues. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40 </span>But let all things be done decently, and according to order. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
