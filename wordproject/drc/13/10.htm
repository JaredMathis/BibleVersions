<h3>Chapter 10 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>Now the Philistines fought against Israel, and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down wounded in mount Gelboe. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And the Philistines drew near pursuing after Saul, and his sons, and they killed Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Melchisua the sons of Saul. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>And the battle grew hard against Saul, and the archers reached him, and wounded him with arrows. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And Saul said to his armourbearer: Draw thy sword, and kill me: lest these uncircumcised come, and mock me. But his armourbearer would not, for he was struck with fear: so Saul took his sword, and fell upon it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>And when his armourbearer saw it, to wit, that Saul was dead, he also fell upon his sword and died. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>So Saul died, and his three sons, and all his house fell together. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>And when the men of Israel, that dwelt in the plains, saw this, they fled: and Saul and his sons being dead, they forsook their cities, and were scattered up and down: and the Philistines came, and dwelt in them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And the next day the Philistines taking away the spoils of them that were slain, found Saul and his sons lying on mount Gelboe. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>And when they had stripped him, and cut off his head, and taken away his armour, they sent it into their land, to be carried about, and shewn in the temples of the idols and to the people. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>And his armour they dedicated in the temple of their god, and his head they fastened up in the temple of Dagon. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And when the men of Jabes Galaad had heard this, to wit, all that the Philistines had done to Saul, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>All the valiant men of them arose, and took the bodies of Saul and of his sons, and brought them to Jabes, and buried their bones under the oak that was in Jabes, and they fasted seven days. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>So Saul died for his iniquities, because he transgressed the commandment of the Lord, which he had commanded, and kept it not: and moreover consulted also a witch, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>And trusted not is the Lord: therefore he slew him, and transferred his kingdom to David the son of Isai. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
