<h3>Chapter 17 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>Now when David was dwelling in his house, he said to Nathan the prophet: Behold I dwell in a house of cedar : and the ark of the covenant of the Lord is under skins. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And Nathan said to David: Do all that is in thy heart: for God is with thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>Now that night the word of God came to Nathan, saying: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>Go, and speak to David my servant: Thus saith the Lord: Thou shalt not build me a house to dwell in. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>For I have not remained in a house from the time that I brought up Israel, to this day: but I have been always changing places in a tabernacle, and in a tent, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>Abiding with all Israel. Did I ever speak to any one, of all the judges of Israel, whom I charged to feed my people, saying: Why have you not built me a house of cedar? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>Now therefore thus shalt thou say to my servant David: Thus saith the Lord of hosts: I took thee from the pastures, from following the flock, that thou shouldst be ruler of my people Israel. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast gone: and have slain all thy enemies before thee, and have made thee a name like that of one of the great ones that are renowned in the earth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>And I have given a place to my people Israel: they shall be planted, and shall dwell therein, and shall be moved no more, neither shall the children of iniquity waste them, as at the beginning, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>Since the days that I gave judges to my people Israel, and have humbled all thy enemies. And I declare to thee, that the Lord will build thee a house. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And when thou shalt have ended thy days to go to thy fathers, I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons: and I will establish his kingdom. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>He shall build me a house, and I will establish his throne for ever. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>But I will settle him in my house, and in my kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be most firm for ever. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak to David. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>And king David came and sat before the Lord, and said: Who am I, O Lord God, and what is my house, that thou shouldst give such things to me? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>But even this hath seemed little in thy sight, and therefore thou hast also spoken concerning the house of thy servant for the time to come: and best made me remarkable above all men, O Lord God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>What can David add more, seeing thou hast thus glorified thy servant, and known him? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>O Lord, for thy servant's sake, according to thy own heart, thou hast shewn all this magnificence, and wouldst have all the great things to be known. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>O Lord there is none like thee: and there is no other God beside thee, of all whom we have heard of with our ears. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>For what other nation is there upon earth like thy people Israel, whom God went to deliver, and make a people for himself, and by his greatness and terrors cast out nations before their face whom he had delivered out of Egypt? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>And thou hast made thy people Israel to be thy own people for ever, and thou, O Lord, art become their God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>Now therefore, O Lord, let the word which thou hast spoken to thy servant, and concerning his house, be established for ever, and do as thou hast said. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>And let thy name remain and be magnified for ever: and let it be said: The Lord of hosts is God of Israel, and the house of David his servant remaineth before him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>For thou, O Lord my God, hast revealed to the ear of thy servant, that thou wilt build him a house: and therefore thy servant hath found confidence to pray before thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>And now O Lord, thou art God: and thou hast promised to thy servant such great benefits. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>And thou hast begun to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be always before thee: for seeing thou blessest it, O Lord, it shall be blessed for ever. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
