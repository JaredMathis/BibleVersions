<h3>Chapter 3 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>Aleph. I am the man that see my poverty by the rod of his indignation. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>Aleph. He hath led me, and brought me into darkness, and not into light. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>Aleph. Only against me he hath turned, and turned again his hand all the day. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>Beth. My skin and my flesh he hath made old, he hath broken my bones. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>Beth. He hath built round about me, and he hath compassed me with gall and labour. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>Beth. He hath set me in dark places as those that are dead for ever. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>Ghimel. He hath built against me round about, that I may not get out: he hath made my fetters heavy. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>Ghimel. Yea, and when I cry, and entreat, he hath shut out my prayer. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>Ghimel. He hath shut up my ways with square stones, he hath turned my paths upside down. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>Daleth. He is become to me as a bear lying in wait: as a lion in secret places. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>Daleth. He hath turned aside my paths, and hath broken me in pieces, he hath made me desolate. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>Daleth. He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for his arrows. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>He. He hath shot into my reins the daughters of his quiver. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>He. I am made a derision to all my people, their song all the day long. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>He. He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath inebriated me with wormwood. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>Vau. And he hath broken my teeth one by one, he hath fed me with ashes. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>Vau. And my soul is removed far off from peace, I have forgotten good things. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>Vau. And I said: My end and my hope is perished from the Lord. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>Zain. Remember my poverty, and transgression, the wormwood, and the gall. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>Zain. I will be mindful and remember, and my soul shall languish within me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>Zain. These things I shall think over in my heart, therefore will I hope. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>Heth. The mercies of the Lord that we are not consumed: because his commiserations have not failed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>Heth. They are new every morning, great is thy faithfulness. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>Heth. The Lord is my portion, said my soul: therefore will I wait for him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>Teth. The Lord is good to them that hope in him, to the soul that seeketh him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>Teth. It is good to wait with silence for the salvation of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>Teth. It is good for a man, when he hath borne the yoke from his youth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>Jod. He shall sit solitary, and hold his peace: because he hath taken it up upon himself. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>Jod. He shall put his mouth in the dust, if so be there may be hope. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>Jod. He shall give his cheek to him that striketh him, he shall be filled with reproaches. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>Caph. For the Lord will not cast off for ever. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>Caph. For if he hath cast off, he will also have mercy, according to the multitude of his mercies. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>Caph. For he hath not willingly afflicted, nor cast off the children of men. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34 </span>Lamed. To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the land, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35 </span>Lamed. To turn aside the judgment of a man before the face of the most High, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36 </span>Lamed. To destroy a man wrongfully in his judgment, the Lord hath not approved. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37 </span>Mem. Who is he that hath commanded a thing to be done, when the Lord commandeth it not? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38 </span>Mem. Shall not both evil and good proceed out of the mouth of the Highest? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39 </span>Mem. Why hath a living man murmured, man suffering for his sins? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40 </span>Nun. Let us search our ways, and seek, and return to the Lord. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41 </span>Nun. Let us lift up our hearts with our hands to the Lord in the heavens. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42 </span>Nun. We have done wickedly, and provoked thee to wrath: therefore thou art inexorable. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="43">43 </span>Samech. Thou hast covered in thy wrath, and hast struck us: thou hast killed and hast not spared. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="44">44 </span>Samech. Thou hast set a cloud before thee, that our prayer may not pass through. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="45">45 </span>Samech. Thou hast made me as an outcast, and refuse in the midst of the people. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="46">46 </span>Phe. All our enemies have opened their mouths against us. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="47">47 </span>Phe. Prophecy is become to us a fear, and a snare, and destruction. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="48">48 </span>Phe. My eye hath run down with streams of water, for the destruction of the daughter of my people. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="49">49 </span>Ain. My eye is afflicted, and hath not been quiet, because there was no rest: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="50">50 </span>Ain. Till the Lord regarded and looked down from the heavens. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="51">51 </span>Ain. My eye hath wasted my soul because of all the daughters of my city. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="52">52 </span>Sade. My enemies have chased me and caught me like a bird, without cause. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="53">53 </span>Sade. My life is fallen into the pit, and they have laid a stone over me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="54">54 </span>Sade. Waters have flowed over my head: I said: I am cut off. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="55">55 </span>Coph. I have called upon thy name, O Lord, from the lowest pit. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="56">56 </span>Coph. Thou hast heard my voice: turn not away thy ear from my sighs, and cries. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="57">57 </span>Coph. Thou drewest near in the day, when I called upon thee, thou saidst: Fear not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="58">58 </span>Res. Thou hast judged, O Lord, the cause of my soul, thou the Redeemer of my life. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="59">59 </span>Res. Thou hast seen, O Lord, their iniquity against me: judge thou my judgment. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="60">60 </span>Res. Thou hast seen all their fury, and all their thoughts against me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="61">61 </span>Sin. Thou hast heard their reproach, O Lord, all their imaginations against me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="62">62 </span>Sin. The lips of them that rise up against me: and their devices against me all the day. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="63">63 </span>Sin. Behold their sitting down, and their rising up, I am their song. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="64">64 </span>Thau. Thou shalt render them a recompense, O Lord, according to the works of their hands. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="65">65 </span>Thau. Thou shalt give them a buckler of heart, thy labour. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="66">66 </span>Thau. Thou shalt persecute them in anger, and shalt destroy them from under the heavens, O Lord. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
