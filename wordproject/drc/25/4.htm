<h3>Chapter 4 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>Aleph. How is the gold become dim, the finest colour is changed, the stones of the sanctuary are scattered in the top of every street? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>Beth. The noble sons of Sion, and they that were clothed with the best gold: how are they esteemed as earthen vessels, the work of the potter's hands? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>Ghimel. Even the sea monsters have drawn out the breast, they have given suck to their young: the daughter of my people is cruel, like the ostrich in the desert. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>Daleth. The tongue of the sucking child hath stuck to the roof of his mouth for thirst: the little ones have asked for bread, and there was none to break it unto them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>He. They that were fed delicately have died in the streets; they that were brought up in scarlet have embraced the dung. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>Vau. And the iniquity of the daughter of my people is made greater than the sin of Sodom, which was overthrown in a moment, and hands took nothing in her. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>Zain. Her Nazarites were whiter than snow, purer than milk, more ruddy than the old ivory, fairer than the sapphire. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>Heth. Their face is now made blacker than coals, and they are not known in the streets: their skin hath stuck to their bones, it is withered, and is become like wood. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>Teth. It was better with them that were slain by the sword, than with them that died with hunger: for these pined away being consumed for want of the fruits of the earth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>Jod. The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children: they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>Caph. The Lord hath accomplished his wrath, he hath poured out his fierce anger: and he hath kindled a fire in Sion, and it hath devoured the foundations thereof. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>Lamed. The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world would not have believed, that the adversary and the enemy should enter in by the gates of Jerusalem. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>Mem. For the sins of her prophets, and the iniquities of her priests, that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>Nun. They have wandered as blind men in the streets, they were defiled with blood: and when they could not help walking in it, they held up their skirts. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>Samech. Depart you that are defiled, they cried out to them: Depart, get ye hence, touch not: for they quarrelled, and being removed, they said among the Gentiles: He will no more dwell among them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>Phe. The face of the Lord hath divided them, he will no more regard them: they respected not the persons of the priests, neither had they pity on the ancient. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>Ain. While we were yet standing, our eyes failed, expecting help for us in vain, when we looked attentively towards a nation that was not able to save. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>Sade. Our steps have slipped in the way of our streets, our end draweth near: our days are fulfilled, for our end is come. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>Coph. Our persecutors were swifter than the eagles of the air: they pursued us upon the mountains, they lay in wait for us in the wilderness. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>Res. The breath of our mouth, Christ the Lord, is taken in our sins: to whom we said: Under thy shadow we shall live among the Gentiles. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>Sin. Rejoice, and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the land of Hus: to thee also shall the cup come, thou shalt be made drunk, and naked. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>Thau. Thy iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Sion, he will no more carry thee away into captivity: he visited thy iniquity, O daughter of Edom, he hath discovered thy sins. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
