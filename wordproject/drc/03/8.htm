<h3>Chapter 8 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>Take Aaron with his sons, their vestments, and the oil of unction, a calf for sin, two rams, a basket with unleavened bread, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>And thou shalt gather together all the congregation to the door of the tabernacle. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And Moses did as the Lord had commanded. And all the multitude being gathered together before the door of the tabernacle, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>He said: This is the word that the Lord hath commanded to be done. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>And immediately he offered Aaron and his sons: and when he had washed them, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>He vested the high priest with the strait linen garment, girding him with the girdle, and putting on him the violet tunick, and over it he put the ephod, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And binding it with the girdle, he fitted it to the rational, on which was Doctrine and Truth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>He put also the mitre upon his head: and upon the mitre over the forehead, he put the plate of gold, consecrated with sanctification, as the Lord had commanded him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>He took also the oil of unction, with which he anointed the tabernacle, with all the furniture thereof. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And when he had sanctified and sprinkled the altar seven times, he anointed it, and all the vessels thereof, and the laver with the foot thereof, he sanctified with the oil. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And he poured it upon Aaron's head, and he anointed and consecrated him : 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And after he had offered his sons, he vested them with linen tunicks, and girded them with girdles, and put mitres on them as the Lord had commanded. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>He offered also the calf for sin: and when Aaron and his sons had put their hands upon the head thereof, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>He immolated it: and took the blood, and dipping his finger in it, he touched the horns of the altar round about. Which being expiated, and sanctified, he poured the rest of the blood at the bottom thereof. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>But the fat that was upon the entrails, and the caul of the liver, and the two little kidneys, with their fat, he burnt upon the altar: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And the calf with the skin, and the flesh and the dung, he burnt without the camp, as the Lord had commanded. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>He offered also a ram for a holocaust: and when Aaron and his sons had put their hands upon its head, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>He immolated it, and poured the blood thereof round about upon the altar. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>And cutting the ram into pieces, the head thereof, and the joints, and the fat he burnt in the fire, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>Having first washed the entrails, and the feet, and the whole ram together he burnt upon the altar, because it was a holocaust of most sweet odour to the Lord, as he had commanded him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>He offered also the second ram, in the consecration of priests: and Aaron, and his sons put their hands upon the head thereof: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>And when Moses had immolated it, he took of the blood thereof, and touched the tip of Aaron's right ear, and the thumb of his right hand, and in like manner also the great toe of his right foot. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>He offered also the sons of Aaron: and when with the blood of the ram that was immolated, he had touched the tip of the right ear of every one of them, and the thumbs of their right hands, and the great toes of their right feet, the rest he poured on the altar round about: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>But the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that covereth the entrails, and the caul of the liver, and the two kidneys with their fat, and with the right shoulder, he separated. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>And taking out of the basket; of unleavened bread, which was before the Lord, a loaf without leaven, and a cake tempered with oil and a wafer, he put them upon the fat, and the right shoulder, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>Delivering all to Aaron, and to his sons: wile having lifted them up before the Lord, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>He took them again from their hands, and burnt them upon the altar of holocaust, because it was the oblation of consecration, for a sweet odour of sacrifice to the Lord. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>And he took of the ram of consecration, the breast for his portion, elevating it before the Lord, as the Lord had commanded him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>And taking the ointment, and the blood that was upon the altar, he sprinkled Aaron, and his vestments, and his sons, and their vestments with it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>And when he had sanctified them in their vestments, he commanded them, saying: Boil the flesh before the door of the tabernacle, and there eat it. Eat ye also the loaves of consecration, that are laid in the basket, as the Lord commanded me, saying: Aaron and his sons shall eat them: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>And whatsoever shall be left of the flesh and the leaves, shall be consumed with fire. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>And you shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle for seven days, until the day wherein the time of your consecration shall be expired. For in seven days the consecration is finished: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34 </span>As at this present it hath been done, that the rite of the sacrifice might be accomplished. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35 </span>Day and night shall you remain in the tabernacle observing the watches of the Lord, lest you die: for so it hath been commanded me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36 </span>And Aaron and his sons did all things which the Lord spoke by the hand of Moses. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
