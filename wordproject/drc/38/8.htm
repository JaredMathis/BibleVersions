<h3>Chapter 8 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>And the word of the Lord of hosts came to me, saying: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>Thus saith the Lord of hosts: I have been jealous for Sion with a great jealousy, and with a great indignation have I been jealous for her. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>Thus saith the Lord of hosts: I am returned to Sion, and I will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called The city of truth, and the mountain of the Lord of hosts, The sanctified mountain. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>Thus saith the Lord of hosts: There shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem: and every man with his staff in his hand through multitude of days. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls, playing in the streets thereof. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>Thus saith the Lord of hosts: If it seem hard in the eyes of the remnant of this people in those days: shall it be hard in my eyes, saith the Lord of hosts? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>Thus saith the Lord of hosts : Behold I will save my people from the land of the east, and from the land of the going down of the sun. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God in truth and in justice. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Let your hands be strengthened, you that hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets, in the day that the house of the Lord of hosts was founded, that the temple might be built. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>For before those days there was no hire for men, neither was there hire for beasts, neither was there peace to him that came in, nor to him that went out, because of the tribulation: and I let all men go every one against his neighbour. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>But now I will not deal with the remnant of this people according to the former days, saith the Lord of hosts. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>But there shall be the seed of peace: the vine shall yield her fruit, and the earth shall give her increase, and the heavens shall give their dew: and I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these things. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And it shall come to pass, that as you were a curse among the Gentiles, O house of Juda, and house of Israel: so will I save you, and you shall be a blessing: fear not, let your hands be strengthened. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>For thus saith the Lord of hosts: As I purposed to afflict you, when your fathers had provoked me to wrath, saith the Lord, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And I had no mercy: so turning again I have thought in these days to do good to the house of Juda, and Jerusalem: fear not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>These then are the things, which you shall do: Speak ye truth every one to his neighbour: judge ye truth and judgment of peace in your gates. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his friend: and love not a false oath: for all these are the things that I hate, saith the Lord. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>And the word of the Lord of hosts came to me, saying: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>Thus saith the Lord of hosts: The fast of the fourth month, and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth shall be to the house of Juda, joy, and gladness, and great solemnities: only love ye truth and peace. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>Thus saith the Lord of hosts, until people come, and dwell in many cities, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>And the inhabitants go one to another, saying: Let us go, and entreat the face of the Lord, and let us seek the Lord of hosts: I also will go. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>And many peoples, and strong nations shall come to seek the Lord of hosts in Jerusalem, and to entreat the face of the Lord. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>Thus saith the Lord of hosts : In those days, wherein ten men of all languages of the Gentiles shall take hold, and shall hold fast the shirt of one that is a Jew, saying: We will go with you: for we have heard that God is with you. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
