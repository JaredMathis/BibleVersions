<h3>Chapter 14 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>Behold the days of the Lord shall come, and thy spoils shall be divided in the midst of thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And I will gather all nations to Jerusalem to battle, and the city shall be taken, and the houses shall be rifled, and the women shall be defiled: and half of the city shall go forth into captivity, and the rest of the people shall not be taken away out of the city. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>Then the Lord shall go forth, and shall fight against those nations, as when he fought in the day of battle. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives, which is over against Jerusalem toward the east: and the mount of Olives shall be divided in the midst thereof to the east, and to the west with a very great opening, and half of the mountain shall be separated to the north, and half thereof to the south. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>And you shall flee to the valley of those mountains, for the valley of the mountains shall be joined even to the next, and you shall flee r as you fled from the face of the earthquake in the days of Ozias king of Juda: and the Lord my God shall come, and all the saints with him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>And it shall come to pass in that day, that there shall be no light, but cold and frost. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>And there shall be one day, which is known to the Lord, not day nor night : and in the time of the evening there shall be light. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And it shall come to pass in that day, that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem: half of them to the east sea, and half of them to the last sea: they shall be in summer and in winter. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>And the Lord shall be king over all the earth: in that day there shall be one Lord, and his name shall be one. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>And all the land shall return even to the desert, from the hill to Remmon to the south of Jerusalem: and she shall be exalted, and shall dwell in her own place, from the gate of Benjamin even to the place of the former gate, and even to the gate of the corners: and from the tower of Hananeel even to the king's wine- presses. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And people shall dwell in it, and there shall be no more an anathema: but Jerusalem shall sit secure. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And this shall be the plague where with the Lord shall strike all nations that have fought against Jerusalem: the flesh of every one shall consume away while they stand upon their feet, and their eyes shall consume away in their holes, and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>In that day there shall be a great tumult from the Lord among them: and a man shall take the hand of his neighbour, and his hand shall be clasped upon his neighbour's hand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>And even Juda shall fight against Jerusalem: and the riches of all nations round about shall be gathered together, gold, and silver, and garments in great abundance. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And the destruction of the horse, and of the mule, and of the camel, and of the ass, and of all the beasts, that shall be in those tents, shall be like this destruction. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>And all they that shall be left of all nations that came against Jerusalem, shall go up from year to year, to adore the King, the Lord of hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And it shall come to pass, that he that shall not go up of the families of the land to Jerusalem, to adore the King, the Lord of hosts, there shall be no rain upon them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>And if the family of Egypt go not up nor come: neither shall it be upon them, but there shall be destruction wherewith the Lord will strike all nations that will not go up to keep the feast of tabernacles. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>This shall be the sin of Egypt, and this the sin of all nations, that will not go up to keep the feast of tabernacles. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>In that day that which is upon the bridle of the horse shall be holy to the Lord: and the caldrons in the house of the Lord shall be as the phials before the altar. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>And every caldron in Jerusalem and Juda shall be sanctified to the Lord of hosts: and all that sacrifice shall come, and take of them, and shall seethe in them: and the merchant shall be no more in the house of the Lord of hosts in that day. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
