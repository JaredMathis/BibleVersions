<h3>Chapter 1 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>There was a man in the land of Hus, whose name was Job, and that man was simple and upright, and fearing God, and avoiding evil. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And there were born to him seven sons and three daughters. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>And his possession was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a family exceeding great: and this man was great among all the people of the east. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And his sons went, and made a feast by houses every one in his day. And sending they called their three sisters to eat and drink with them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>And when the days of their feasting were gone about, Job sent to them, and sanctified them: and rising up early offered holocausts for every one of them. For he said: Lest perhaps my sons have sinned, and have blessed God in their hearts. So did Job all days. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>Now on a certain day when the sons of God came to stand before the Lord, Satan also was present among them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>And the Lord said to him: Whence comest thou ? And he answered and said: I have gone round about the earth, and walked through it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And the Lord said to him: Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a simple and upright man, and fearing God, and avoiding evil? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>And Satan answering, said: Doth Job fear God in vain ? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>Hast not thou made a fence for him, and his house, and all his substance round about, blessed the works of his hands, and his possession hath increased on the earth ? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>But stretch forth thy hand a little, and touch all that he hath, and see if he blesseth thee not to thy face. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>Then the Lord said to Satan: Behold, all that he hath is in thy hand: only put not forth thy hand upon his person. And Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>Now upon a certain day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their eldest brother, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>There came a messenger to Job, and said: The oxen were ploughing, and the asses feeding beside them, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And the Sabeans rushed in, and took all away, and slew the servants with the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>And while he was yet speaking, another came, and said: The fire of God fell from heaven, and striking the sheep and the servants, hath consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And while he also was yet speaking, there came another, and said: The Chaldeans made three troops, and have fallen upon the camels, and taken them, moreover they have slain the servants with the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>He was yet speaking, and behold another came in, and said: Thy sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their elder brother: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>A violent wind came on a sudden from the side of the desert, and shook the four corners of the house, and it fell upon thy children and they are dead, and I alone have escaped to fell thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>Then Job rose up, and rent his garments, and having shaven his head fell down upon the ground and worshipped, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>And said: Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away: as it hath pleased the Lord so is it done: blessed be the name of the Lord. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>In all these things Job sinned not by his lips, nor spoke he any foolish thing against God. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
