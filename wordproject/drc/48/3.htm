<h3>Chapter 3 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>O senseless Galatians, who hath bewitched you that you should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been set forth, crucified among you? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>This only would I learn of you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>Are you so foolish, that, whereas you began in the Spirit, you would now be made perfect by the flesh? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>Have you suffered so great things in vain? If it be yet in vain. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>He therefore who giveth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you; doth he do it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of the faith? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>As it is written: Abraham believed God, and it was reputed to him unto justice. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>Know ye therefore, that they who are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And the scripture, foreseeing, that God justifieth the Gentiles by faith, told unto Abraham before: In thee shall all nations be blessed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>Therefore they that are of faith, shall be blessed with faithful Abraham. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>For as many as are of the works of the law, are under a curse. For it is written: Cursed is every one, that abideth not in all things, which are written in the book of the law to do them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>But that in the law no man is justified with God, it is manifest: because the just man liveth by faith. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>But the law is not of faith: but, He that doth those things, shall live in them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written: Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Christ Jesus: that we may receive the promise of the Spirit by faith. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>Brethren (I speak after the manner of man,) yet a man's testament, if it be confirmed, no man despiseth, nor addeth to it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>To Abraham were the promises made and to his seed. He saith not, And to his seeds, as of many: but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>Now this I say, that the testament which was confirmed by God, the law which was made after four hundred and thirty years, doth not disannul, to make the promise of no effect. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise. But God gave it to Abraham by promise. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>Why then was the law? It was set because of transgressions, until the seed should come, to whom he made the promise, being ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>Now a mediator is not of one: but God is one. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>Was the law then against the promises of God? God forbid. For if there had been a law given which could give life, verily justice should have been by the law. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise, by the faith of Jesus Christ, might be given to them that believe. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>But before the faith came, we were kept under the law shut up, unto that faith which was to be revealed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>Wherefore the law was our pedagogue in Christ, that we might be justified by faith. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>But after the faith is come, we are no longer under a pedagogue. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>For you are all the children of God by faith, in Christ Jesus. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>For as many of you as have been baptized in Christ, have put on Christ. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>There is neither Jew nor Greek: there is neither bond nor free: there is neither male nor female. For you are all one in Christ Jesus. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>And if you be Christ's, then are you the seed of Abraham, heirs according to the promise. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
