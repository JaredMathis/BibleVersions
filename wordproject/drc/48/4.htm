<h3>Chapter 4 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>Now I say, as long as the heir is a child, he differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed by the father: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>So we also, when we were children, were serving under the elements of the world. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent his Son, made of a woman, made under the law: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>That he might redeem them who were under the law: that we might receive the adoption of sons. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>And because you are sons, God hath sent the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying: Abba, Father. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>Therefore now he is not a servant, but a son. And if a son, an heir also through God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>But then indeed, not knowing God, you served them, who, by nature, are not gods. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>But now, after that you have known God, or rather are known by God: how turn you again to the weak and needy elements, which you desire to serve again? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>You observe days, and months, and times, and years. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>I am afraid of you, lest perhaps I have laboured in vain among you. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>Be ye as I, because I also am as you: brethren, I beseech you: you have not injured me at all. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And you know, how through infirmity of the flesh, I preached the gospel to you heretofore: and your temptation in my flesh, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>You despised not, nor rejected: but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>Where is then your blessedness? For I bear you witness, that, if it could be done, you would have plucked out your own eyes, and would have given them to me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>Am I then become your enemy, because I tell you the truth? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>They are zealous in your regard not well: but they would exclude you, that you might be zealous for them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>But be zealous for that which is good in a good thing always: and not only when I am present with you. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>My little children, of whom I am in labour again, until Christ be formed in you. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>And I would willingly be present with you now, and change my voice: because I am ashamed for you. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>Tell me, you that desire to be under the law, have you not read the law? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>For it is written that Abraham had two sons: the one by a bondwoman, and the other by a free woman. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>But he who was of the bondwoman, was born according to the flesh: but he of the free woman, was by promise. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>Which things are said by an allegory. For these are the two testaments. The one from mount Sina, engendering unto bondage; which is Agar: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>For Sina is a mountain in Arabia, which hath affinity to that Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>But that Jerusalem, which is above, is free: which is our mother. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>For it is written: Rejoice, thou barren, that bearest not: break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for many are the children of the desolate, more than of her that hath a husband. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>But as then he, that was born according to the flesh, persecuted him that was after the spirit; so also it is now. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>But what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son; for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the free woman. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>So then, brethren, we are not the children of the bondwoman, but of the free: by the freedom wherewith Christ has made us free. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
