<h3>Chapter 1 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>Paul, an apostle, not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And all the brethren who are with me, to the churches of Galatia. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>Grace be to you, and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present wicked world, according to the will of God and our Father: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>To whom is glory for ever and ever. Amen. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>I wonder that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ, unto another gospel. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>Which is not another, only there are some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach a gospel to you besides that which we have preached to you, let him be anathema. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>As we said before, so now I say again: If any one preach to you a gospel, besides that which you have received, let him be anathema. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>For do I now persuade men, or God? Or do I seek to please men? If I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>For I give you to understand, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>For neither did I receive it of man, nor did I learn it; but by the revelation of Jesus Christ. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>For you have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion: how that, beyond measure, I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>And I made progress in the Jews' religion above many of my equals in my own nation, being more abundantly zealous for the traditions of my fathers. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>But when it pleased him, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles, immediately I condescended not to flesh and blood. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>Neither went I to Jerusalem, to the apostles who were before me: but I went into Arabia, and again I returned to Damascus. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>Then, after three years, I went to Jerusalem, to see Peter, and I tarried with him fifteen days. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>But other of the apostles I saw none, saving James the brother of the Lord. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>Now the things which I write to you, behold, before God, I lie not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>And I was unknown by face to the churches of Judea, which were in Christ: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>But they had heard only: He, who persecuted us in times past, doth now preach the faith which once he impugned: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>And they glorified God in me. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
