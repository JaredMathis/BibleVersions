<h3>Chapter 3 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>Behold what manner of charity the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called, and should be the sons of God. Therefore the world knoweth not us, because it knew not him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>Dearly beloved, we are now the sons of God; and it hath not yet appeared what we shall be. We know, that, when he shall appear, we shall be like to him: because we shall see him as he is. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>And every one that hath this hope in him, sanctifieth himself, as he also is holy. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>Whosoever committeth sin commmitteth also iniquity; and sin is iniquity. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>And you know that he appeared to take away our sins, and in him there is no sin. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>Whosoever abideth in him, sinneth not; and whosoever sinneth, hath not seen him, nor known him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>Little children, let no man deceive you. He that doth justice is just, even as he is just. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>He that commmitteth sin is of the devil: for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose, the Son of God appeared, that he might destroy the works of the devil. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>Whosoever is born of God, commmitteth not sin: for his seed abideth in him, and he can not sin, because he is born of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil. Whosoever is not just, is not of God, nor he that loveth not his brother. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>For this is the declaration, which you have heard from the beginning, that you should love one another. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>Not as Cain, who was of the wicked one, and killed his brother. And wherefore did he kill him? Because his own works were wicked: and his brother's just. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>Wonder not, brethren, if the world hate you. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not, abideth in death. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer. And you know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in himself. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>In this we have known the charity of God, because he hath laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>He that hath the substance of this world, and shall see his brother in need, and shall shut up his bowels from him: how doth the charity of God abide in him? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>My little children, let us not love in word, nor in tongue, but in deed, and in truth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>In this we know that we are of the truth: and in his sight shall persuade our hearts. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>For if our heart reprehend us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>Dearly beloved, if our heart do not reprehend us, we have confidence towards God: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>And whatsoever we shall ask, we shall receive of him: because we keep his commandments, and do those things which are pleasing in his sight. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>And this is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ: and love one another, as he hath given commandment unto us. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>And he that keepeth his commandments, abideth in him, and he in him. And in this we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
