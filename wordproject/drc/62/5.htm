<h3>Chapter 5 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ, is born of God. And every one that loveth him who begot, loveth him also who is born of him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>In this we know that we love the children of God: when we love God, and keep his commandments. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>For this is the charity of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not heavy. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>For whatsoever is born of God, overcometh the world: and this is the victory which overcometh the world, our faith. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>This is he that came by water and blood, Jesus Christ: not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit which testifieth, that Christ is the truth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>And there are three who give testimony in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost. And these three are one. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And there are three that give testimony on earth: the spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three are one. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater. For this is the testimony of God, which is greater, because he hath testified of his Son. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>He that believeth in the Son of God, hath the testimony of God in himself. He that believeth not the Son, maketh him a liar: because he believeth not in the testimony which God hath testified of his Son. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And this is the testimony, that God hath given to us eternal life. And this life is in his Son. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>He that hath the Son, hath life. He that hath not the Son, hath not life. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>These things I write to you, that you may know that you have eternal life, you who believe in the name of the Son of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>And this is the confidence which we have towards him: That, whatsoever we shall ask according to his will, he heareth us. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And we know that he heareth us whatsoever we ask: we know that we have the petitions which we request of him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>He that knoweth his brother to sin a sin which is not to death, let him ask, and life shall be given to him, who sinneth not to death. There is a sin unto death: for that I say not that any man ask. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>All iniquity is sin. And there is a sin unto death. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>We know that whosoever is born of God, sinneth not: but the generation of God preserveth him, and the wicked one toucheth him not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>We know that we are of God, and the whole world is seated in wickedness. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>And we know that the Son of God is come: and he hath given us understanding that we may know the true God, and may be in his true Son. This is the true God and life eternal. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
