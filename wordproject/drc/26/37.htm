<h3>Chapter 37 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>The hand of the Lord was upon me, and brought me forth in the spirit of the Lord: and set me down in the midst of a plain that was full of bones. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And he led me about through them on every side: now they were very many upon the face of the plain, and they were exceeding dry. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>And he said to me: Son of man, dost thou think these bones shall live? And I answered: O Lord God, thou knowest. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And he said to me: Prophesy concerning these bones; and say to them: Ye dry bones, hear the word of the Lord. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>Thus saith the Lord God to these bones: Behold, I will send spirit into you, and you shall live. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>And I will lay sinews upon you, and will cause flesh to grow over you, and will cover you with skin: and I will give you spirit and you shall live, and you shall know that I am the Lord. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>And I prophesied as he had commanded me: and as I prophesied there was a noise, and behold a commotion: and the bones came together, each one to its joint. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And I saw, and behold the sinews, and the flesh came up upon them: and the skin was stretched out over them, but there was no spirit in them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>And he said to me: Prophesy to the spirit, prophesy, O son of man, and say to the spirit: Thus saith the Lord God: Come, spirit, from the four winds, and blow upon these slain, and let them live again. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>And I prophesied as he had commanded me: and the spirit came into them, and they lived: and they stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And he said to me: Son of man: All these bones are the house of Israel : they say: Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost, and we are cut off. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>Therefore prophesy, and say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold I will open your graves, and will bring you out of your sepulchres, O my people: and will bring you into the land of Israel. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And you shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall have opened your sepulchres, and shall have brought you out of your graves, O my people: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>And shall have put my spirit in you, and you shall live, and I shall make you rest upon your own land: and you shall know that I the Lord have spoken, and done it, saith the Lord God: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>And thou son of man, take thee a stick: and write upon it: Of Juda, and of the children of Israel his associates: and take another stick and write upon it: For Joseph the stick of Ephraim, and for all the house of Israel, and of his associates. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And join them one to the other into one stick, and they shall become one in thy hand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>And when the children of thy people shall speak to thee, saying: Wilt thou not tell us what thou meanest by this? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>Say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel that are associated with him, and I will put them together with the stick of Juda, and will make them one stick: and they shall be one in his hand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>And the sticks whereon thou hast written, shall be in thy hand, before their eyes. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>And thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I will take the children of Israel from the midst of the nations whither they are gone: and I will gather them on every side, and will bring them to their own land. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>And I will make them one nation in the land on the mountains of Israel, and one king shall be king over them all: and they shall no more be two nations, neither shall they be divided any more into two kingdoms. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>Nor shall they be defiled any more with their idols, nor with their abominations, nor with all their iniquities: and I will save them out of all the places in which they have sinned, and I will cleanse them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>And my servant David shall be king over them, and they shall have one shepherd: they shall walk in my judgments, and shall keep my commandments, and shall do them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>And they shall dwell in the land which I gave to my servant Jacob, wherein your fathers dwelt, and they shall dwell in it, they and their children, and their children's children, for ever: and David my servant shall be their prince for ever. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>And I will make a covenant of peace with them, it shall be an everlasting covenant with them : and I will establish them, and will multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for ever. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>And my tabernacle shall be with them: and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>And the nations shall know that I am the Lord the sanctifier of Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for ever. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
