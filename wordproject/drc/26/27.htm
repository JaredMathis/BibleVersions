<h3>Chapter 27 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>Thou therefore, O son of man, take up a lamentation for Tyre: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>And say to Tyre that dwelleth at the entry of the sea, being the mart of the people for many islands: Thus saith the Lord God: O Tyre, thou hast said: I am of perfect beauty, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And situate in the heart of the sea. Thy neighbours, that built thee, have perfected thy beauty: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>With fir trees of Sanir they have built thee with all sea planks: they have taken cedars from Libanus to make thee masts. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>They have cut thy oars out of the oaks of Basan: and they have made thee benches of Indian ivory and cabins with things brought from the islands of Italy. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>Fine broidered linen from Egypt was woven for thy sail, to be spread on thy mast: blue and purple from the islands of Elisa, were made thy covering. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>The inhabitants of Sidon, and the Arabians were thy rowers : thy wise men, O Tyre, were thy pilots. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>The ancients of Gebal, and the wise men thereof furnished mariners for the service of thy various furniture: all the ships of the sea, and their mariners were thy factors. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>The Persians, and Lydians, and the Libyans were thy soldiers in thy army: they hung up the buckler and the helmet in thee for thy ornament. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>The men of Arad were with thy army upon thy walls round about: the Pygmeans also that were in thy towers, hung up their quivers on thy walls round about: they perfected thy beauty. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>The Carthaginians thy merchants supplied thy fairs with a multitude of all kinds of riches, with silver, iron, tin, and lead. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>Greece, Thubal, and Mosoch, they were thy merchants: they brought to thy people slaves and vessels of brass. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>From the house of Thogorma they brought horses, and horsemen, and mules to thy market. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>The men of Dedan were thy merchants: many islands were the traffic of thy hand, they exchanged for thy price teeth of ivory and ebony. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>The Syrian was thy merchant: by reason of the multitude of thy works, they set forth precious stones, and purple, and broidered works, and fine linen, and silk, and chodchod in thy market. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>Juda and the land of Israel, they were thy merchants with the best corn: they set forth balm, and honey, and oil, and rosin in thy fairs. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>The men of Damascus were thy merchants in the multitude of thy works, in the multitude of divers riches, in rich wine, in wool of the best colour. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>Dan, and Greece, and Mosel have set forth in thy marts wrought iron: stacte, and calamus were in thy market. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>The men of Dedan were thy merchants in tapestry for seats. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>Arabia, and all the princes of Cedar, they were the merchants of thy hand: thy merchants came to thee with lambs, and rants, and kids. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>The sellers of Saba, and Reema, they were thy merchants: with all the best spices, and precious stones, and gold, which they set forth in thy market. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>Haran, and Chene, and Eden were thy merchants; Saba, Assur, and Chelmad sold to thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>They were thy merchants in divers manners, with bales of blue cloth, and of embroidered work, and of precious riches, which were wrapped up and bound with cords: they had cedars also in thy merchandise. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>The ships of the sea, were thy chief in thy merchandise : and thou wast replenished, and glorified exceedingly in the heart of the sea. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters: the south wind hath broken thee in the heart of the sea. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>Thy riches, and thy treasures, and thy manifold furniture, thy mariners, and thy pilots, who kept thy goods, and were chief over thy people: thy men of war also, that were in thee, with all thy multitude that is in the midst of thee: shall fall in the heart of the sea in the day of thy ruin. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>Thy fleets shall be troubled at the sound of the cry of thy pilots. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>And all that handled the oar shall come down from their ships: the mariners, and all the pilots of the sea shall stand upon the land: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>And they shall mourn over thee with a loud voice, and shall cry bitterly: and they shall cast up dust upon their heads, and shall be sprinkled with ashes. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>And they shall shave themselves bald for thee, and shall be girded with haircloth: and they shall weep for thee with bitterness of soul, with most bitter weeping. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>And they shall take up a mournful song for thee, and snail lament thee: What city is like Tyre, which is become silent in the midst of the sea? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>Which by thy merchandise that went from thee by sea didst fill many people: which by the multitude of thy riches, and of thy people didst enrich the kings of the earth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34 </span>Now thou art destroyed by the sea, thy riches are in the bottom of the waters, and all the multitude that was in the midst of thee is fallen. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35 </span>All the inhabitants of the islands are astonished at thee: and all their kings being struck with the storm have changed their countenance. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36 </span>The merchants of people have hissed at thee: thou art brought to nothing, and thou shalt never be any more. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
