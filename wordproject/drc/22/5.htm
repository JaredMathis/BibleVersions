<h3>Chapter 5 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat the fruit of his apple trees. I am come into my garden, O my sister, my spouse, I have gathered my myrrh, with my aromatical spices: I have eaten the honeycomb with my honey, I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends, and drink, and be inebriated, my dearly beloved. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>I sleep, and my heart watcheth; the voice of my beloved knocking: Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is full of dew, and my locks of the drops of the nights. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>I have put off my garment, how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet, how shall I defile them? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>My beloved put his hand through the key hole, and my bowels were moved at his touch. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>I arose up to open to my beloved: my hands dropped with myrrh, and my fingers were full of the choicest myrrh. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>I opened the bolt of my door to my beloved: but he had turned aside, and was gone. My soul melted when he spoke: I sought him, and found him not: I called, and he did not answer me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>The keepers that go about the city found me: they struck me: and wounded me: the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if you find my beloved, that you tell him that I languish with love. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>What manner of one is thy beloved of the beloved, O thou most beautiful among women? what manner of one is thy beloved of the beloved, that thou hast so adjured us? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>My beloved is white and ruddy, chosen out of thousands. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>His head is as the finest gold: his locks as branches of palm trees, black as a raven. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>His eyes as doves upon brooks of waters, which are washed with milk, and sit beside the plentiful streams. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>His cheeks are as beds of aromatical spices set by the perfumers. His lips are as lilies dropping choice myrrb. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>His hands are turned and as of gold, full of hyacinths. His belly as of ivory, set with sapphires. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>His legs as pillars of marble, that are set upon bases of gold. His form as of Libanus, excellent as the cedars. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>His throat most sweet, and he is all lovely: such is my beloved, and he is my friend, O ye daughters of Jerusalem. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
