<h3>Chapter 12 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>If I must glory (it is not expedient indeed): but I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>I know a man in Christ above fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I know not, or out of the body, I know not; God knoweth), such a one caught up to the third heaven. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>And I know such a man (whether in the body, or out of the body, I know not: God knoweth): 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>That he was caught up into paradise, and heard secret words, which it is not granted to man to utter. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>For such an one I will glory; but for myself I will glory nothing, but in my infirmities. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>For though I should have a mind to glory, I shall not be foolish; for I will say the truth. But I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth in me, or any thing he heareth from me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>And lest the greatness of the revelations should exalt me, there was given me a sting of my flesh, an angel of Satan, to buffet me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>For which thing thrice I besought the Lord, that it might depart from me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>And he said to me: My grace is sufficient for thee; for power is made perfect in infirmity. Gladly therefore will I glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may dwell in me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>For which cause I please myself in my infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ. For when I am weak, then am I powerful. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>I am become foolish: you have compelled me. For I ought to have been commended by you: for I have no way come short of them that are above measure apostles, although I be nothing. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>Yet the signs of my apostleship have been wrought on you, in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>For what is there that you have had less than the other churches, but that I myself was not burthensome to you? Pardon me this injury. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>Behold now the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burthensome unto you. For I seek not the things that are yours, but you. For neither ought the children to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>But I most gladly will spend and be spent myself for your souls; although loving you more, I be loved less. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>But be it so: I did not burthen you: but being crafty, I caught you by guile. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>Did I overreach you by any of them whom I sent to you? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>I desired Titus, and I sent with him a brother. Did Titus overreach you? Did we not walk with the same spirit? did we not in the same steps? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>Of old, think you that we excuse ourselves to you? We speak before God in Christ; but all things, my dearly beloved, for your edification. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>For I fear lest perhaps when I come I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found by you such as you would not. Lest perhaps contentions, envyings, animosities, dissensions, detractions, whisperings, swellings, seditions, be among you. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>Lest again, when I come, God humble me among you: and I mourn many of them that sinned before, and have not done penance for the uncleanness, and fornication, and lasciviousness, that they have committed. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
