<h3>Chapter 5 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>In that day Debbora and Barac son of Abinoem sung, and said: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>O you of Israel, that have willingly offered your lives to danger, bless the Lord. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>Hear, O ye kings, give ear, ye princes: It is I, it is I, that will sing to the Lord, I will sing to the Lord the God of Israel. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>O Lord, when thou wentest out of Seir, and passedst by the regions of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped water. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>The mountains melted before the face of the Lord, and Sinai before the face of the Lord the God of Israel. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>In the days of Samgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jahel the paths rested: and they that went by them, walked through by-ways. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>The valiant men ceased, and rested in Israel: until Debbora arose, a mother arose in Israel. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>The Lord chose new wars, and he himself overthrew the gates of the enemies: a shield and spear was not seen among forty thousand of Israel. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>My heart loveth the princes of Israel: O you that of your own good will offered yourselves to danger, bless the Lord. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>Speak, you that ride upon fair asses, and you that sit in judgment, and walk in the way. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>Where the chariots were dashed together, and the army of the enemies was choked, there let the justices of the Lord be rehearsed, and his clemency towards the brave men of Israel: then the people of the Lord went down to the gates, and obtained the sovereignty. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>Arise, arise, O Debbora, arise, arise, and utter a canticle. Arise, Barac, and take hold of thy captives, O son of Abinoem. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>The remnants of the people are saved, the Lord hath fought among the valiant ones. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>Out of Ephraim he destroyed them into Amalec, and after him out of Benjamin into thy people, O Amalec: Out of Machir there came down princes, and out of Zabulon they that led the army to fight. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>The captains of Issachar were with Debbora, and followed the steps of Barac, who exposed himself to danger, as one going headlong, and into a pit. Ruben being divided against himself, there was found a strife of courageous men. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>Why dwellest thou between two borders, that thou mayest hear the bleatings of the flocks? Ruben being divided against himself, there was found a strife of courageous men. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>Galaad rested beyond the Jordan, and Dan applied himself to ships: Aser dwelt on the sea shore, and abode in the havens. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>But Zabulon and Nephtali offered their lives to death in the region of Merome. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>The kings came and fought, the kings of Chanaan fought in Thanach by the waters of Mageddo, and yet they took no spoils. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>War from heaven was made against them, the stars remaining in their order and courses fought against Sisara. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>The torrent of Cison dragged their carcasses, the torrent of Cadumim, the torrent of Cisoii: tread thou, my soul, upon the strong ones. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>The hoofs of the horses were broken whilst the stoutest of the enemies fled amain, and fell headlong down. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>Curse ye the land of Meroz, said the angel of the Lord: curse the inhabitants thereof, because they came not to the help of the Lord, to help his most valiant men. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>Blessed among women be Jahel the wife of Haber the Cinite, and blessed be she in her tent. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>He asked her water and she gave him milk, and offered him butter in a dish fit for princes. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>She put her left hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workman's hammer, and she struck Sisara, seeking in his head a place for the wound, and strongly piercing through his temples. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>At her feet he fell: he fainted, and he died: he rolled before her feet, and he lay lifeless and wretched. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>His mother looked out at a window, and howled: and she spoke from the dining room: Why is his chariot so long in coming back? Why are the feet of his horses so slow? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>One that was wiser than the rest of his wives, returned this answer to her mother in law: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>Perhaps he is now dividing the spoils, and the fairest of the women is chosen out for him: garments of divers colours are given to Sisara for his prey, and furniture of different kinds is heaped together to adorn the necks. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>So let all thy enemies perish, O Lord: but let them that love thee shine, as the sun shineth in his rising. And the land rested for forty years. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
