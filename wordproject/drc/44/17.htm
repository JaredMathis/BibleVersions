<h3>Chapter 17 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>AND when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And Paul, according to his custom, went in unto them; and for three sabbath days he reasoned with them out of the scriptures: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>Declaring and insinuating that the Christ was to suffer, and to rise again from the dead; and that this is Jesus Christ, whom I preach to you. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And some of them believed, and were associated to Paul and Silas; and of those that served God, and of the Gentiles a great multitude, and of noble women not a few. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>But the Jews, moved with envy, and taking unto them some wicked men of the vulgar sort, and making a tumult, set the city in an uproar; and besetting Jason's house, sought to bring them out unto the people. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>And not finding them, they drew Jason and certain brethren to the rulers of the city, crying: They that set the city in an uproar, are come hither also; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>Whom Jason hath received; and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And they stirred up the people, and the rulers of the city hearing these things, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>And having taken satisfaction of Jason and of the rest, they let them go. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>But the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea. Who, when they were come thither, went into the synagogue of the Jews. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>Now these were more noble than those in Thessalonica, who received the word with all eagerness, daily searching the scriptures, whether these things were so. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And many indeed of them believed, and of honourable women that were Gentiles, and of men not a few. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was also preached by Paul at Berea, they came thither also, stirring up and troubling the multitude. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul, to go unto the sea; but Silas and Timothy remained there. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And they that conducted Paul, brought him as far as Athens; and receiving a commandment from him to Silas and Timothy, that they should come to him with all speed, they departed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>Now whilst Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred within him, seeing the city wholly given to idolatry. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>He disputed, therefore, in the synagogue with the Jews, and with them that served God, and in the marketplace, every day with them that were there. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>And certain philosophers of the Epicureans and of the Stoics disputed with him; and some said: What is it, that this word sower would say? But others: He seemeth to be a setter forth of new gods; because he preached to them Jesus and the resurrection. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>And taking him, they brought him to the Areopagus, saying: May we know what this new doctrine is, which thou speakest of? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>For thou bringest in certain new things to our ears. We would know therefore what these things mean. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>(Now all the Athenians, and strangers that were there, employed themselves in nothing else, but either in telling or in hearing some new thing.) 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>But Paul standing in the midst of the Areopagus, said: Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things you are too superstitious. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>For passing by, and seeing your idols, I found an altar also, on which was written: To the unknown God. What therefore you worship, without knowing it, that I preach to you: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>God, who made the world, and all things therein; he, being Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>Neither is he served with men's hands, as though he needed any thing; seeing it is he who giveth to all life, and breath, and all things: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>And hath made of one, all mankind, to dwell upon the whole face of the earth, determining appointed times, and the limits of their habitation. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>That they should seek God, if happily they may feel after him or find him, although he be not far from every one of us: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>For in him we live, and move, and are; as some also of your own poets said: For we are also his offspring. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>Being therefore the offspring of God, we must not suppose the divinity to be like unto gold, or silver, or stone, the graving of art, and device of man. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>And God indeed having winked at the times of this ignorance, now declareth unto men, that all should every where do penance. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>Because he hath appointed a day wherein he will judge the world in equity, by the man whom he hath appointed; giving faith to all, by raising him up from the dead. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>And when they had heard of the resurrection of the dead, some indeed mocked, but others said: We will hear thee again concerning this matter. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>So Paul went out from among them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34 </span>But certain men adhering to him, did believe; among whom was also Dionysius, the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
