<h3>Chapter 24 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>AND after five days the high priest Ananias came down, with some of the ancients, and one Tertullus an orator, who went to the governor against Paul. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And Paul being called for, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying: Whereas through thee we live in much peace, and many things are rectified by thy providence, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>We accept it always and in all places, most excellent Felix, with all thanksgiving. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>But that I be no further tedious to thee, I desire thee of thy clemency to hear us in few words. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>We have found this to be a pestilent man, and raising seditions among all the Jews throughout the world, and author of the sedition of the sect of the Nazarenes. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom, we having apprehended, would also have judged according to our law. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>But Lysias the tribune coming upon us, with great violence took him away out of our hands; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>Commanding his accusers to come to thee: of whom thou mayest thyself, by examination, have knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>And the Jews also added, and said that these things were so. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>Then Paul answered, (the governor making a sign to him to speak:) Knowing that for many years thou hast been judge over this nation, I will with good courage answer for myself. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>For thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days, since I went up to adore in Jerusalem: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And neither in the temple did they find me disputing with any man, or causing any concourse of the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>Neither can they prove unto thee the things whereof they now accuse me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>But this I confess to thee, that according to the way, which they call a heresy, so do I serve the Father and my God, believing all things which are written in the law and the prophets: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>Having hope in God, which these also themselves look for, that there shall be a resurrection of the just and unjust. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>And herein do I endeavour to have always a conscience without offence toward God, and towards men. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>Now after many years, I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings, and vows. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>In which I was found purified in the temple: neither with multitude, nor with tumult. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>But certain Jews of Asia, who ought to be present before thee, and to accuse, if they had any thing against me: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>Or let these men themselves say, if they found in me any iniquity, when standing before the council, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>Except it be for this one voice only that I cried, standing among them, Concerning the resurrection of the dead am I judged this day by you. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>And Felix put them off, having most certain knowledge of this way, saying: When Lysias the tribune shall come down, I will hear you. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>And he commanded a centurion to keep him, and that he should be easy, and that he should not prohibit any of his friends to minister unto him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>And after some days, Felix, coming with Drusilla his wife, who was a Jew, sent for Paul, and heard of him the faith, that is in Christ Jesus. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>And as he treated of justice, and chastity, and of the judgment to come, Felix being terrified, answered: For this time, go thy way: but when I have a convenient time, I will send for thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>Hoping also withal, that money should be given him by Paul; for which cause also oftentimes sending for him, he spoke with him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>But when two years were ended, Felix had for successor Portius Festus. And Felix being willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
