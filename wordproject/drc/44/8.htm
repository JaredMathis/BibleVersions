<h3>Chapter 8 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>AND at that time there was raised a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all dispersed through the countries of Judea, and Samaria, except the apostles. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And devout men took order for Stephen's funeral, and made great mourning over him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>But Saul made havock of the church, entering in from house to house, and dragging away men and women, committed them to prison. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>They therefore that were dispersed, went about preaching the word of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>And Philip going down to the city of Samaria, preached Christ unto them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>And the people with one accord were attentive to those things which were said by Philip, hearing, and seeing the miracles which he did. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>For many of them who had unclean spirits, crying with a loud voice, went out. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And many, taken with the palsy, and that were lame, were healed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>There was therefore great joy in that city. Now there was a certain man named Simon, who before had been a magician in that city, seducing the people of Samaria, giving out that he was some great one: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>To whom they all gave ear, from the least to the greatest, saying: This man is the power of God, which is called great. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And they were attentive to him, because, for a long time, he had bewitched them with his magical practices. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>But when they had believed Philip preaching of the kingdom of God, in the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>Then Simon himself believed also; and being baptized, he adhered to Philip. And being astonished, wondered to see the signs and exceeding great miracles which were done. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>Now when the apostles, who were in Jerusalem, had heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>Who, when they were come, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>For he was not as yet come upon any of them; but they were only baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>Then they laid their hands upon them, and they received the Holy Ghost. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>And when Simon saw, that by the imposition of the hands of the apostles, the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>Saying: Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I shall lay my hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost. But Peter said to him: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>Keep thy money to thyself, to perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>Thou hast no part nor lot in this matter. For thy heart is not right in the sight of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>Do penance therefore for this thy wickedness; and pray to God, that perhaps this thought of thy heart may be forgiven thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>For I see thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bonds of iniquity. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>Then Simon answering, said: Pray you for me to the Lord, that none of these things which you have spoken may come upon me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>And they indeed having testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel to many countries of the Samaritans. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>Now an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying: Arise, go towards the south, to the way that goeth down from Jerusalem into Gaza: this is desert. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>And rising up, he went. And behold a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch, of great authority under Candace the queen of the Ethiopians, who had charge over all her treasures, had come to Jerusalem to adore. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>And he was returning, sitting in this chariot, and reading Isaias the prophet. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>And the Spirit said to Philip: Go near, and join thyself to this chariot. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>And Philip running thither, heard him reading the prophet Isaias. And he said: Thinkest thou that thou understandest what thou readest? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>Who said: And how can I, unless some man shew me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>And the place of the scripture which he was reading was this: He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb without voice before his shearer, so openeth he not his mouth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>In humility his judgment was taken away. His generation who shall declare, for his life shall be taken from the earth? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34 </span>And the eunuch answering Philip, said: I beseech thee, of whom doth the prophet speak this? of himself, or of some other man? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35 </span>Then Philip, opening his mouth, and beginning at this scripture, preached unto him Jesus. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36 </span>And as they went on their way, they came to a certain water; and the eunuch said: See, here is water: what doth hinder me from being baptized? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37 </span>And Philip said: If thou believest with all thy heart, thou mayest. And he answering, said: I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38 </span>And he commanded the chariot to stand still; and they went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch: and he baptized him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39 </span>And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord took away Philip; and the eunuch saw him no more. And he went on his way rejoicing. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40 </span>But Philip was found in Azotus; and passing through, he preached the gospel to all the cities, till he came to Caesarea. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
