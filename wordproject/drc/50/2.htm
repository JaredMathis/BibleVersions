<h3>Chapter 2 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of charity, if any society of the spirit, if any bowels of commiseration: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>Fulfil ye my joy, that you may be of one mind, having the same charity, being of one accord, agreeing in sentiment. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>Let nothing be done through contention, neither by vain glory: but in humility, let each esteem others better than themselves: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>Each one not considering the things that are his own, but those that are other men's. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>For let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>Who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>But emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men, and in habit found as a man. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>He humbled himself, becoming obedient unto death, even to the death of the cross. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>For which cause God also hath exalted him, and hath given him a name which is above all names: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>That in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those that are in heaven, on earth, and under the earth: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And that every tongue should confess that the Lord Jesus Christ is in the glory of God the Father. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>Wherefore, my dearly beloved, (as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but much more now in my absence,) with fear and trembling work out your salvation. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>For it is God who worketh in you, both to will and to accomplish, according to his good will. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>And do ye all things without murmurings and hesitations; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>That you may be blameless, and sincere children of God, without reproof, in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation; among whom you shine as lights in the world. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>Holding forth the word of life to my glory in the day of Christ, because I have not run in vain, nor laboured in vain. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>Yea, and if I be made a victim upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice, and congratulate with you all. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>And for the selfsame thing do you also rejoice, and congratulate with me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>And I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy unto you shortly, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know the things concerning you. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>For I have no man so of the same mind, who with sincere affection is solicitous for you. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>For all seek the things that are their own; not the things that are Jesus Christ's. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>Now know ye the proof of him, that as a son with the father, so hath he served with me in the gospel. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>Him therefore I hope to send unto you immediately, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>And I trust in the Lord, that I myself also shall come to you shortly. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>But I have thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow labourer, and fellow soldier, but your apostle, and he that hath ministered to my wants. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>For indeed he longed after you all: and was sad, for that you had heard that he was sick. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>For indeed he was sick, nigh unto death; but God had mercy on him; and not only on him, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>Therefore I sent him the more speedily: that seeing him again, you may rejoice, and I may be without sorrow. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>Receive him therefore with all joy in the Lord; and treat with honour such as he is. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>Because for the work of Christ he came to the point of death: delivering his life, that he might fulfil that which on your part was wanting towards my service. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
