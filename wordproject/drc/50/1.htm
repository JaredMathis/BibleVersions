<h3>Chapter 1 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>Paul and Timothy, the servants of Jesus Christ; to all the saints in Christ Jesus, who are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>Grace be unto you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>I give thanks to my God in every remembrance of you, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>Always in all my prayers making supplication for you all, with joy; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>For your communication in the gospel of Christ from the first day until now. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>Being confident of this very thing, that he, who hath begun a good work in you, will perfect it unto the day of Christ Jesus. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>As it is meet for me to think this for you all, for that I have you in my heart; and that in my bands, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers of my joy. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>For God is my witness, how I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>And this I pray, that your charity may more and more abound in knowledge, and in all understanding: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>That you may approve the better things, that you may be sincere and without offence unto the day of Christ, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>Filled with the fruit of justice, through Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>Now, brethren, I desire you should know, that the things which have happened to me, have fallen out rather to the furtherance of the gospel: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>So that my bands are made manifest in Christ, in all the court, and in all other places; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>And many of the brethren in the Lord, growing confident by my bands, are much more bold to speak the word of God without fear. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>Some indeed, even out of envy and contention; but some also for good will preach Christ. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>Some out of charity, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And some out of contention preach Christ not sincerely: supposing that they raise affliction to my bands. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>But what then? So that by all means, whether by occasion, or by truth, Christ be preached: in this also I rejoice, yea, and will rejoice. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>For I know that this shall fall out to me unto salvation, through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>According to my expectation and hope; that in nothing I shall be confounded, but with all confidence, as always, so now also shall Christ be magnified in my body, wither it be by life, or by death. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>For to me, to live is Christ; and to die is gain. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>And if to live in the flesh, that is to me the fruit of labour, and what I shall choose I know not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>But I am straitened between two: having a desire to be dissolved and to be with Christ, a thing by far the better. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>But to abide still in the flesh, is needful for you. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide, and continue with you all, for your furtherance and joy of faith: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>That your rejoicing may abound in Christ Jesus for me, by my coming to you again. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>Only let your conversation be worthy of the gospel of Christ: that, whether I come and see you, or, being absent, may hear of you, that you stand fast in one spirit, with one mind labouring together for the faith of the gospel. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>And in nothing be ye terrified by the adversaries: which to them is a cause of perdition, but to you of salvation, and this from God: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>For unto you it is given for Christ, not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>Having the same conflict as that which you have seen in me, and now have heard of me. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
