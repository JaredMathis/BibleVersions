<h3>Chapter 2 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ of glory with respect of persons. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>For if there shall come into your assembly a man having a golden ring, in fine apparel, and there shall come in also a poor man in mean attire, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>And you have respect to him that is clothed with the fine apparel, and shall say to him: Sit thou here well; but say to the poor man: Stand thou there, or sit under my footstool: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>Do you not judge within yourselves, and are become judges of unjust thoughts? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>Hearken, my dearest brethren: hath not God chosen the poor in this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which God hath promised to them that love him? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>But you have dishonoured the poor man. Do not the rich oppress you by might? and do not they draw you before the judgment seats? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>Do not they blaspheme the good name that is invoked upon you? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>If then you fulfil the royal law, according to the scriptures, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself; you do well. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>But if you have respect to persons, you commit sin, being reproved by the law as transgressors. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>And whosoever shall keep the whole law, but offend in one point, is become guilty of all. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>For he that said, Thou shalt not commit adultery, said also, Thou shalt not kill. Now if thou do not commit adultery, but shalt kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>So speak ye, and so do, as being to be judged by the law of liberty. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>For judgment without mercy to him that hath not done mercy. And mercy exalteth itself above judgment. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>What shall it profit, my brethren, if a man say he hath faith, but hath not works? Shall faith be able to save him? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And if a brother or sister be naked, and want daily food: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>And one of you say to them: Go in peace, be ye warmed and filled; yet give them not those things that are necessary for the body, what shall it profit? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>So faith also, if it have not works, is dead in itself. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>But some man will say: Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without works; and I will shew thee, by works, my faith. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>Thou believest that there is one God. Thou dost well: the devils also believe and tremble. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>Was not Abraham our father justified by works, offering up Isaac his son upon the altar? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>Seest thou, that faith did co-operate with his works; and by works faith was made perfect? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>And the scripture was fulfilled, saying: Abraham believed God, and it was reputed to him to justice, and he was called the friend of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>Do you see that by works a man is justified; and not by faith only? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>And in like manner also Rahab the harlot, was not she justified by works, receiving the messengers, and sending them out another way? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>For even as the body without the spirit is dead; so also faith without works is dead. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
