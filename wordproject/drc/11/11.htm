<h3>Chapter 11 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>And king Solomon loved many strange women besides the daughter of Pharao, and women of Moab, and of Ammon, and of Edom, and of Sidon, and of the Hethites: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>Of the nations concerning which the Lord said to the children of Israel: You shall not go in unto them, neither shall any of them come in to yours: for they will most certainly turn away your heart to follow their gods. And to these was Solomon joined with a most ardent love. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>And he had seven hundred wives as queens, and three hundred concubines: and the women turned away his heart. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And when he was now old, his heart was turned away by women to follow strange gods: and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God, as was the heart of David his father. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>But Solomon worshipped Astarthe the goddess of the Sidonians, and Moloch the idol of the ammonites. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>And Solomon did that which was net pleasing before the Lord, and did not fully follow the Lord, as David his father. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>Then Solomon built a temple for Chamos the idol of Moab, on the hill that is over against Jerusalem, and for Moloch the idol of the children of Ammon. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And he did in this manner for all his wives that were strangers, who burnt incense, and offered sacrifice to their gods. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>And the Lord was angry with Solomon, because his mind was turned away from the Lord the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>And had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not follow strange gods: but he kept not the things which the Lord commanded him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>The Lord therefore said to Solomon: Because thou hast done this, and hast not kept my covenant, and my precepts, which I have commanded thee, I will divide and rend thy kingdom, and will give it to thy servant. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>Nevertheless in thy days I will not do it, for David thy father's sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>Neither will I take away the whole kingdom, but I will give one tribe to thy son for the sake of David my servant, and Jerusalem which I have chosen. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>And the Lord raised up an adversary to Solomon, Adad the Edomite of the king's seed, in Edom. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>For when David was in Edom, and Joab the general of the army was gone up to bury them that were slain, and had killed every male in Edom, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>(For Joab remained there six months with all Israel, till he had slain every male in Edom,) 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>Then Adad fled, he and certain Edomites, of his father's servants with him, to go into Egypt: and Adad was then a little boy. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>And they arose out of Madian, and came into Pharan, and they took men with them from Pharan, and went into Egypt to Pharao the king of Egypt: who gave him a house, and appointed him victuals, and assigned him land. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>And Adad found great favour before Pharao, insomuch that he gave him to wife, the own sister of his wife Taphnes the queen. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>And the sister of Taphnes bore him his son Genubath, and Taphnes brought him up in the house of Pharao: and Genubath dwelt with Pharao among his children. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>And when Adad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the general of the army was dead, he add to Pharao: Let me depart, that I may go to my own country. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>And Pharao said to him: Why, what is wanting to thee with me, that thou seekest to go to thy own country? But he answered: Nothing: yet I beseech thee to let me go. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>God also raised up against him an adversary, Razon the son of Eliada, 'who had fled from his master Adarezer the king of Soba: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>And he gathered men against him, and he became a captain of robbers, when David slew them of Soba: and they went to Damascus, and dwelt there, and they made him king in Damascus. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>And he was an adversary to Israel, all the days of Solomon: and this is the evil of Adad, and his hatred against Israel, and he reigned in Syria. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>Jeroboam also the son of Nabat an Ephrathite of Sareda, a servant of Solomon, whose mother was named Sarua, a widow woman, lifted up his hand against the king. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>And this is the cause of his rebellion against him, for Solomon built Mello, and filled up the breach of the city of David his father. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>And Jeroboam was a valiant and mighty man: and Solomon seeing him a young man ingenious and industrious, made him chief over the tributes of all the house of Joseph. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>So it came to paste at that time, that Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, and the prophet Ahias the Silonite, clad with a new garment, found him in the way: and they two were alone in the held. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>And Ahias taking his new garment, wherewith he was clad, divided it into twelve parts: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>nd he said to Jeroboam: Take to thee ten pieces: for thus saith the Lord the God of Israel: Behold I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give thee ten tribes. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>But one tribe shall remain to him for the sake of my servant David, and Jerusalem the city, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>Because he hath forsaken me, and hath adored Astarthe the goddess of the Sidonians, and Chamos the god of Moab, and Moloch the god of the children of Ammon: and hath not walked in my ways, to do justice before me, and to keep my precepts, and judgments as did David his father. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34 </span>Yet I will not take away all the kingdom out of his hand, but I will make him prince all the days of his life, for David my servant's sake, whom I chose, who kept my commandments and my precepts. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35 </span>But I will take away the kingdom out of his son's hand and will give thee ten tribes: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36 </span>And to his son I will give one tribe, that there may remain a lamp for my servant David before me always in Jerusalem the city which I have chosen, that my name might be there. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37 </span>And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign over all that thy soul desireth, and thou shalt be king over Israel. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38 </span>If then thou wilt hearken to all that I shall command thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do what is right before me, keeping my commandments and my precepts, as David my servant did: I will be with thee, and will build thee up a faithful house, as I built a house for David, and I will deliver Israel to thee: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39 </span>And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but yet not for ever. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40 </span>Solomon therefore sought to kill Jeroboam: but he arose, and fled into Egypt to Sesac the king of Egypt, and was in Egypt till the death of Solomon. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41 </span>And the rest of the words of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom: behold they are all written in the book of the words of the days of Solomon. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42 </span>And the days that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel, were forty years. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="43">43 </span>And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father, and Roboam his son reigned in his stead. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
