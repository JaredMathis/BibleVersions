<h3>Chapter 5 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>Hear ye this word, which I take up concerning you for a lamentation. The house of Israel is fallen, and it shall rise no more. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>The virgin of Israel is cast down upon her land, there is none to raise her up. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>For thus saith the Lord God: The city, out of which came forth a thousand, there shall be left in it a hundred: and out of which there came a hundred, there shall be left in it ten, in the house of Israel. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>For thus saith the Lord to the house of Israel: Seek ye me, and you shall live. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>But seek not Bethel, and go not into Galgal, neither shall you pass over to Bersabee: for Galgal shall go into captivity, and Bethel shall be unprofitable. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>Seek ye the Lord, and live: lest the house of Joseph be burnt with fire, and it shall devour, and there shall be none to quench Bethel. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>You that turn judgment into wormwood, and forsake justice in the land, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>Seek him that maketh Arcturus, and Orion, and that turneth darkness into morning, and that changeth day into night: that calleth the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The Lord is his name. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>He that with a smile bringeth destruction upon the strong, and waste upon the mighty. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>They have hated him that rebuketh in the gate: and have abhorred him that speaketh perfectly. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>Therefore because you robbed the poor, and took the choice prey from him: you shall build houses with square stone, and shall not dwell in them: you shall plant most delightful vineyards, and shall not drink the wine of them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>Because I know your manifold crimes, and your grievous sine: enemies of the just, taking bribes, and oppressing the poor in the gate. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>Therefore the prudent shall keep silence at that time, for it is an evil time. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>Seek ye good, and not evil, that you may live: and the Lord the God of hosts will be with you, as you have said. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>Hate evil, and love good, and establish judgment in the gate: it may be the Lord the God of hosts may have mercy on the remnant of Joseph. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>Therefore thus saith the Lord the God of hosts the sovereign Lord: In every street there shall be wailing: and in all places that are without, they shall say: Alas, alas! and they shall call the husbandman to mourning, and such as are skilful in lamentation to lament. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And in all vineyards there shall be wailing: because I will pass through in the midst of thee, saith the Lord. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>Woe to them that desire the day of the Lord: to what end is it for you? the day of the Lord is darkness, and not light. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>As if a man should flee from the face of a lion, and a bear should meet him: or enter into the house, and lean with his hand upon the wall, and a serpent should bite him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>Shall not the day of the Lord be darkness, and not light: and obscurity, and no brightness in it? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>I hate, and have rejected your festivities: and I will not receive the odour of your assemblies. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>And if you offer me holocausts, and your gifts, I will not receive them: neither will I regard the vows of your fat beasts. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>Take away from me the tumult of thy songs: and I will not hear the canticles of thy harp. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>But judgment shall be revealed as water, and justice as a mighty torrent. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>Did you offer victims and sacrifices to me in the desert for forty years, O house of Israel? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>But you carried a tabernacle for your Moloch, and the image of your idols, the star of your god, which you made to yourselves. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>And I will cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, saith the Lord, the God of hosts is his name. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
