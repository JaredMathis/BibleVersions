<h3>Chapter 13 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>Let the charity of the brotherhood abide in you. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And hospitality do not forget; for by this some, being not aware of it, have entertained angels. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>Remember them that are in bands, as if you were bound with them; and them that labour, as being yourselves also in the body. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>Marriage honourable in all, and the bed undefiled. For fornicators and adulterers God will judge. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>Let your manners be without covetousness, contented with such things as you have; for he hath said: I will not leave thee, neither will I forsake thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>So that we may confidently say: The Lord is my helper: I will not fear what man shall do to me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>Remember your prelates who have spoken the word of God to you; whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>Jesus Christ, yesterday, and to day; and the same for ever. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>Be not led away with various and strange doctrines. For it is best that the heart be established with grace, not with meats; which have not profited those that walk in them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>We have an altar, whereof they have no power to eat who serve the tabernacle. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the holies by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people by his own blood, suffered without the gate. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>Let us go forth therefore to him without the camp, bearing his reproach. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>For we have not here a lasting city, but we seek one that is to come. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise always to God, that is to say, the fruit of lips confessing to his name. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>And do not forget to do good, and to impart; for by such sacrifices God's favour is obtained. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>Obey your prelates, and be subject to them. For they watch as being to render an account of your souls; that they may do this with joy, and not with grief. For this is not expedient for you. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>Pray for us. For we trust we have a good conscience, being willing to behave ourselves well in all things. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>And I beseech you the more to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>And may the God of peace, who brought again from the dead the great pastor of the sheep, our Lord Jesus Christ, in the blood of the everlasting testament, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>Fit you in all goodness, that you may do his will; doing in you that which is well pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom is glory for ever and ever. Amen. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>And I beseech you, brethren, that you suffer this word of consolation. For I have written to you in a few words. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty: with whom (if he come shortly) I will see you. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>Salute all your prelates, and all the saints. The brethren from Italy salute you. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>Grace be with you all. Amen. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
