<h3>Chapter 8 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>In the third year of the reign of king Baltasar, a vision appeared to me. I Daniel, after what I had seen in the beginning, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>Saw in my vision when I was in the castle of Susa, which is in the province of Elam: and I saw in the vision that I was over the gate of Ulai. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>And I lifted up my eyes, and saw: and behold a ram stood before the water, having two high horns, and one higher than the other, and growing up. Afterward 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>I saw the ram pushing with his horns against the west, and against the north, and against the south: and no beasts could withstand him, nor be delivered out of his hand: and he did according to his own will, and became great. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>And I understood: and behold a he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and he touched not the ground, and the he goat had a notable horn between his eyes. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>And he went up to the ram that had the horns, which I had seen standing before the gate, and he ran towards him in the force of his strength. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>And when he was come near the ram, he was enraged against him, and struck the ram: and broke his two horns, and the ram could not withstand him: and when he had cast him down on the ground, he stamped upon him, and none could deliver the ram out of his hand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And the he goat became exceeding great: and when he was grown, the great horn was broken, and there came up four horns under it towards the four winds of heaven. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>And out of one of them came forth a little horn: and it became great against the south, and against the east, and against the strength. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>And it was magnified even unto the strength of heaven: and it threw down of the strength, and of the stars, and trod upon them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And it was magnified even to the prince of the strength: and it took away from him the continual sacrifice, and cast down the place of his sanctuary. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And strength was given him against the continual sacrifice, because of sins: and truth shall be cast down on the ground, and he shall do and shall prosper. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And I heard one of the saints speaking, and one saint said to another, I know not to whom that was speaking: How long shall be the vision, concerning the continual sacrifice, and the sin of the desolation that is made: and the sanctuary, and the strength be trodden under foot? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>And he said to him: Unto evening and morning two thousand three hundred days: and the sanctuary shall be cleansed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And it came to pass when I Daniel saw the vision, and sought the meaning, that behold there stood before me as it were the appearance of a man. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>And I heard the voice of a man between Ulai: and he called, and said: Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And he came and stood near where I stood: and when he was come, I fell on my face trembling, and he said to me: Understand, O son of man, for in the time of the end the vision shall be fulfilled. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>And when he spoke to me I fell flat on the ground: and he touched me, and set me upright, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>And he said to me: I will shew thee what things are to come to pass in the end of the malediction: for the time hath its end. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>The ram, which thou sawest with horns, is the king of the Medes and Persians. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>And the he goat, is the king of the Greeks, and the great horn that was between his eyes, the same is the first king. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>But whereas when that was broken, there arose up four for it: four kings shall rise up of his nation, but not with his strength. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>And after their reign, when iniquities shall be grown up, there shall arise a king of a shameless face, and understanding dark sentences. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>And his power shall be strengthened, but not by his own force: and he shall lay all things waste, and shall prosper, and do more than can be believed. And he shall destroy the mighty, and the people of the saints, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>According to his will, and craft shall be successful in his hand: and his heart shall be puffed up, and in the abundance of all things he shall kill many: and he shall rise up against the prince of princes, and shall be broken without hand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>And the vision of the evening and the morning, which was told, is true: thou therefore seal up the vision, because it shall come to pass after many days. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>And I Daniel languished, and was sick for some days: and when I was risen up, I did the king's business, and I was astonished at the vision, and there was none that could interpret it. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
