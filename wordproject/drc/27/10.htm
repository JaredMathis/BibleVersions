<h3>Chapter 10 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">  
 </span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>In the third year of Cyrus king of the Persians, a word was revealed to Daniel surnamed Baltassar, and a true word, and great strength: and he understood the word: for there is need of understanding in a vision. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>In those days I Daniel mourned the days of three weeks. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>I ate no desirable bread, and neither flesh, nor wine entered into my mouth, neither was I anointed with ointment: till the days of three weeks were accomplished. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And in the four and twentieth day of the first month I was by the great river which is the Tigris. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>And I lifted up my eyes, and I saw: and behold a man clothed in linen, and his loins were girded with the finest gold: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>And his body was like the chrysolite, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as a burning lamp: and his arms, and all downward even to the feet, like in appearance to glittering brass: and the voice of his word like the voice of a multitude. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>And I Daniel alone saw the vision: for the men that were with me saw it not: but an exceeding great terror fell upon them, and they fled away, and hid themselves. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And I being left alone saw this great vision: and there remained no strength in me, and the appearance of my countenance was changed in me, and I fainted away, and retained no strength. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>And I heard the voice of his words: and when I heard, I lay in a consternation, upon my face, and my face was close to the ground. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>And behold a hand touched me, and lifted me up upon my knees, and upon the joints of my hands. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And he said to me: Daniel, thou man of desires, understand the words that I speak to thee, and stand upright: for I am sent now to thee. And when he had said this word to me, I stood trembling. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And he said to me: Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that thou didst set thy heart to understand, to afflict thyself in the sight of thy God, thy words have been heard: and I am come for thy words. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>But the prince of the kingdom of the Persians resisted me one and twenty days: and behold Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, and I remained there by the king of the Persians. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>But I am come to teach thee what things shall befall thy people in the latter days, for as yet the vision is for days. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And when he was speaking such words to me, I cast down my countenance to the ground, and held my peace. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>And behold, as it were the likeness of a son of man touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spoke, and said to him that stood before me: O my Lord, at the sight of thee my joints are loosed, and no strength hath remained in me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And how can the servant of my lord speak with my lord? for no strength remaineth in me, moreover my breath is stopped. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>Therefore he that looked like a man touched me again, and strengthened me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>And he said: Fear not, O man of desires, peace be to thee: take courage and be strong. And when he spoke to me, I grew strong: and I said: Speak, O my lord, for thou hast strengthened me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>And he said: Dost thou know wherefore I am come to thee? and now I will return, to fight against the prince of the Persians. When I went forth, there appeared the prince of the Greeks coming. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>But I will tell thee what is set down in the scripture of truth: and none is my helper in all these things, but Michael your prince. </p> <!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->
